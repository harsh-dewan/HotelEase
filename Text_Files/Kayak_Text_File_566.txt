The pics online were of nice hotel rooms but the room we stayed in was a motel next to the main building, the floor was sticky and furniture was bare minimum. It was very cheap, though, so you get what you pay for. A 4.8 Mediocre Anonymous, Oct. 2015 Pros:The front desk was very nice and was courteous. There are a few restaurants in the area. Cons:I thought when I read the reviews, the breakfast was included in the price and they provided transportation to the airport. The breakfast was $5.00 extra per person and there was no transportation to the airport. The hotel is in an older area of town. I have stayed in a lot of hotels and this is a two star hotel.
