Cons:Very slow service is all aspects. Poor room service, the restroom water ran slow! Besides be a very small room, the overall experience was okay. I would not recommend. A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Jul. 2018 Pros:Friendly staff. Cons:The room was so small. A 3.1 Poor Anonymous, Oct. 2017 Pros:the gentleman who takes the bags is the only attentive and helpful Cons:the beds are terrible ... watery and damaged the back, also that in 3 nights never changed linens; On the par of the hotel there is construction and at 7am you can not sleep because the hotel its walls are extremely thin ... EVERYONE HEAR! The lift is only for two people! the employees see you need to occupy the elevator and they never say ok take it ... EVER!

So clean, perfect location R 4.5 Mediocre Rob, Jul. 2016 Pros:Great location Cons:Tiny, tiny, tiny box rooms. Hardly enough room to swing an arm, let alone a cat! A 3.1 Poor Anonymous, May 2016 Pros:Nothing Cons:they made me a fee of $ 100 and never returned to me my card A 8.2 Very good Anonymous, Mar. 2016 Pros:The location can't be beat, a half block off Times Square. We were in town for a concert at Madison Square Garden which was an easy walk from the Hotel. The rooms were modern and unique. I could have easily spent twice as much to stay at one of the brand name hotels nearby but I'm so glad I didn't. Cons:The construction next door created some traffic issues which meant a lot of noise. But we were so exhausted from walking around that we didn't have any trouble falling asleep. The construction itself didn't bother us. B 2.0 Poor Brittani, Nov. 2015 Pros:Nothing. Cons:There was a night club below us that went on until 5am loudly in the morning. They did comp my night thankfully. Horrible experience.
