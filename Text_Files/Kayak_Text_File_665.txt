The facility was clean and well kept. Cons:The coffee shop could have offered more in the way of breakfast food other than sweets. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Sep. 2019 Pros:Room was very clean and comfortable. Toiletries were excellent. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Cons:I was very happy overall but I thought it was quite expensive. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jan. 2018 Pros:Great we could check in at eleven. Very courteous and kind! A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Jan. 2018 Cons:The Mac at the hotel is insecure - used it to print boarding passes and my email account was hacked shortly after. Evening front desk guy was pretty uninterested and unhelpful. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Dec. 2018 Cons:Got hacked right after using the computer at the Burrard to print boarding passes. Don't stay there or use their computer. J 8.8 Very good Janet, Apr. 2017 Pros:The room was clean and cute the whole hotel was perfectly located for everything we wanted to do during our stay. Cons:Each day we were woken up by extremely loud drilling(?) vacuuming (?) some very loud noise multiple times during each morning of our stay. N 10.0 Wonderful nate, Mar. 2016 Pros:Went to vancouver to take in a cannucks game. Great location enjoyed use of bikes. Bikrd around town and to the stadium/arena. Great food and bars nearby. Cons:Brief but we'll planned power outage related to upgrading to a system issue was performed midday and had little affect on my stay B 10.0 Wonderful Brittany, Mar. 2016 Pros:Very quiet, incredible location for nightlife and dining, extremely friendly and helpful staff. I highly recommend the burrard and will be staying here again soon. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2015 Pros:The advertising, decor, and overall theme of the hotel has a purposely kitschy vibe -- it was playful and charming. The staff was friendly, the room was clean, the free wifi was quick and responsive, and the location was very central to all of the sights around town that I had in my plans. The bed was comfortable, and the furnishings & amenities certainly met my needs. Cons:There isn't a lot to criticize. The room was a tad small, but as a lone traveler, this didn't bother me at all. The location is next to a hospital, but aside from occasional flashing ambulance lights, there wasn't really any more noise than I'd imagine one would hear being adjacent to any street in the city.
