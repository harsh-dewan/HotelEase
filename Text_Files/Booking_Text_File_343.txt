An easy walk to the strip but yet away from the hustle and bustle, crowds and noise. This corner unit is the prime location in the MGM Signature buildings. The north end of building 3 doesn't look onto the other buildings like 1&2, there is also a fantastic view of The Sphere from the bedroom and balcony. Have already recommended this unit to friends.
