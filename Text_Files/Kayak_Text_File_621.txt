Clean and comfortable rooms. Cons:Bathrooms are definitley dated and could use remodeling, but they are clean and functional. Rooms need more lighting (just two desk lamps, which is not enough). A 10.0 Wonderful Albert, Apr. 2019 Pros:Close to everything downtown, staff was excellent , the room was clean . Cons:Pillows could have been better and looked into there website and saw robes in there gallery pics but asked the front desk if they had robes and didn’t have any? K 6.8 Okay Kellen, Jan. 2018 Pros:The staff were warm, helpful, and welcoming. The room was clean and tidy. It is very central to Downtown, Yaletown, and The West End. The price was very good for the time of year as well. Cons:I think I will spring for a nicer hotel next time. There's no nice way to say the bed was barely a real mattress, and the blankets and bedding were like tissue paper. I would recommend it to someone on a tight budget, or to younger people who value price over physical comfort, but overall the bed was uncomfortable. The rooms are also painted red which I found weird. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Dec. 2017 Pros:Location was nice and able to walk to a lot of places. Cons:Although discounted parking was available that wasn’t known until after I had checked in and already found and paid for parking. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:It was the location that I loved most. I just walked to where I needed to go and it's near everywhere. Cons:Nothing to not like. A 4.8 Mediocre Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:It it centrally located to the Granville strip so it's close for all the nightlife Cons:The elevator was broken, the walls are paper thin you can hear everything and because the building is old the floor creaks BADLY! The people above us kept us up all night and day walking around right above our bed. Their floor/our ceiling was a night mare! I had to call the front desk twice to complain and try to get them to stop pacing yet nothing happened. It's a cute neiche hotel but I wouldn't go back. A 6.8 Okay Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Pros:Close to many restaurants and shopping. A good value overall but only if you plan to be out and about. Cons:Cramped and noisy. Thankfully hotel staff did move us to a higher floor after the first night. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Dec. 2015 Pros:Love the history of the hotel, great staff and a great location. Cons:It may be an old hotel with some cool history, but it could still do with some cleaner finishes like some new carpet and a better paint job. A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:Location Cons:Beds are uncomfortable A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Aug. 2015 Pros:Comfortable bed, easy access to everything in downtown,very near the waterfront where the cruise ships dock.
