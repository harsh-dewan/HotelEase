Beds were okay for one night (we bought sleeping bags after reading all the reviews and i suggest you do the same). Cons:Dirty, incredibly loud street noise but you have to keep the window open because it's so hot and stuffy and there's no fan. Black mold in the bathroom. Fine for one night and only if you're used to hostels or traveling on the super cheap.
