The location of this hostel is perfect for exploring the Vieux Québec area! Keeping in mind that it is a hostel and not a full service hotel, the service was good. Our room was not cleaned when we got to it. The front desk agent came up and got us sheets but the trash was left full of the past guests refuse. There is no elevator for guests. Cleanliness was just ok and there were several shower and toilet stalls that were out of order. Bed was hard and thin mattress but this is consistent with hostels. Several school groups were visiting at the time that we were and this was where our real issue arose - kids running up and down the halls and stairwells until at lead midnight each of the 3 nights we stayed. At a hostel you do expect a certain amount of noise but not groups of kids playing football and tag in the hallways until late. Overall the stay was just ok but nothing special. You get what you pay for and other places to stay in the area were easily 3x the price or more.
