Good location. Front desk staff seemed overwhelmed, even when checking in at 10 pm. A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Dec. 2018 Pros:I liked that it cost me under $100 for a nights stay. Heat also worked very well in the suite. Cons:Either it’s the construction of the place or just very loud people, but I could hear a consenting scratching and banging throughout the night and morning until about 10am.
