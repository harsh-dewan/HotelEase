This laid-back resort is also conveniently situated next to the I-15. Built in 1976 on 38 acres and originally opened as "The Casino," it became Palace Station, the flagship property for the Station Casinos empire, in 1991. Although the resort has undergone various renovations, including a new resort pool and a complete renovation of the casino, restaurants, and all guest rooms in 2018, it's kept a down-to-earth vibe. WHY WE LOVE IT: Palace Station is within walking distance of several other restaurants and a short drive from downtown and the Strip - putting guests near the epicenter of all the big happenings in Las Vegas. Ideal for meetings and special celebrations, Palace Station also features more than 20,000 square feet of event space. It's equipped with state-of-the-art amenities including projectors, DVD players and other technological devices. Catering and other services are available as well.

The casino floor is always busy at Palace Station. You'll find plenty of action in the bingo hall, keno lounge, or the race and sports book, which boasts 230 seats and 44 large video screens. There's numerous table games and more than 1,600 slot and video poker machines. The resort is unique in that it has an Asian table games area, where guests can try their luck at pai gow tiles and both mini and midi baccarat. The Oyster Bar is an 18-seat, live-action kitchen preparing freshly shucked oysters, steamed clams and homemade seafood pastas.
