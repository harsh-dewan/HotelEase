Walking distance to liquor store, timmies and McDonald's. Cons:We stayed with young kids and the pool was closed 2/4 nights!!! Which is awful when travelling with kids who want to water slide. The reason we stayed there was for the pool and waterside( in the evenings) Do not stay here if that's important to you. Pillows very bad! Like a sack of cotton Balls.
