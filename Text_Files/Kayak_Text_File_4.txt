One of our key cards worked out of two, as soon as we walked into our room there was dirt on the carpet, I removed the blanket and on the sheets beneath were different hairs and blood stains. Our neighbours were loud two different nights, I asked the clerk at the front desk when quiet time was and she replied with 11. And it was already 12 15 before I went down and asked. The problem was resolved in about 15 minutes A 4.8 Mediocre Anonymous, Sep. 2017 Cons:This establishment is not 3 stars. The hotel has no elevator nor do they serve breakfast like most other comfort inns. The room wasn't up to par either with the sink broken, bathtub unclean and worst of all blood on the door! The entire place reminded us more of a motel than a 3 star hotel. A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Apr. 2017 Pros:Staff were very friendly, room was comfortable, located five minutes from West Ed Mall and many restaurants surrounding the hotel. Will stay here the next time I'm in Edmonton. A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:The staff was friendly & the rooms were clean. Cons:Rooms outdated.
