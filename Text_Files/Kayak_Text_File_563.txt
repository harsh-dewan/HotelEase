It isn't the newest but for a place to sleep that is clean it can't be beat. I would stay here again Cons:This isn't necessarily an issue for me but if you are older and/or have trouble going up and down stairs you need to reserve a room on the first floor. The steps are steep and short going up stairs so people with mobility issues need to know this.
