When I stayed the room renos were not complete but other than the carpet the room was very clean. Nice bathroom reno and the bed and linens and comforter were new and very comfortable. Big surprise was the 50 " tv. Wifi was good. Free continental breakfast was normal, the coffee and juices were good. Staff were very friendly and helpful, kudos go to Rebecca for being exceptional. In summary, if you are not looking for a 5 star resort but like a comfortable nights sleep, friendly staff and a good location, this may very well be the place. I know that I will stay here again. RECOMMENDED. Cons:The carpet needed to be replaced. The second floor locked ice machine location was inconvenient. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Pros:They are always accommodating. They help with taxis and airport busses and anything else you might want or need.
