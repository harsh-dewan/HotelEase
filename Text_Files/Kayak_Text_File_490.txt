Fantastic price and amazing room. Loved it. Cons:Bed was a bit short.. lol T 10.0 Wonderful Todd, Jun. 2019 Pros:Staff was super friendly and helpful. In suite laundry was major bonus to wash and dry running gear before packing into suitcase. Room comfortable, well appointed. Historical building was neat, lobby nice, convenient location downtown. Valet parking was expensive but necessary as there appeared nothing convenient around. Well suited to transit and walking. Views were fantastic from 36th floor suite, and gym was great, with super views, on 17th floor. Sandwich/pastry shop off lobby was good, Starbucks immediately across street. Cons:No in suite breakfast option, so either be prepared (and make use of in suite kitchen), hit restaurant downstairs (which seemed expensive), or plan for pastry or coffee shop mere steps away. S 10.0 Wonderful Saida, Apr. 2019 Pros:The place had a nice kitchenette, with even a washing machine and a dishwasher.
