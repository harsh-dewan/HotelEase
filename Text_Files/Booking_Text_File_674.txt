Offering a unique glimpse into Japanese living, this property type usually features tatami rooms (‘washitsu’ in Japanese) – furnished with traditional tatami mat flooring – and restorative onsen (hot springs) as their hallmark features. As each year ends, with businesses and schools closing in Japan, ryokans become centres for reflection and renewal, making them an integral part of the winter season. Guests can cleanse body and mind as they conclude the old year and start the new one, often while enjoying breathtaking views, including the first sunrise for good luck. To help you discover sought-after havens during the peak winter season and beyond, we've handpicked six must-visit ryokans in Japan. Each promises a one-of-a-kind and immersive stay, allowing you to unwind and rejuvenate in luxury. Tachibana Shikitei Enjoy the tranquillity and cultural joy of a traditional Japanese ryokan interior In the heart of the city Kaga, Tachibana Shikitei beckons with its Meiji period allure. This venerable ryokan exudes a sense of rich history, featuring meticulously tended gardens, antique furnishings and tranquil tatami rooms. During your stay, indulge in the tradition of kaiseki dining – a multi-course meal comprised of fresh and locally sourced luxury ingredients – once exclusively reserved for royalty. This culinary delight embodies the Japanese concept of omotenashi, signifying wholehearted and impeccable hospitality. For the ultimate ryokan experience, consider a room with a private onsen. Tachibana Shikitei's is also located just 30 minutes by car from Komatsu Airport. For those who prefer train travel, Tachibana Shikitei provides staying guests with a complimentary pick-up service from Kaga-Onsen Train Station, which is only a 10-minute drive away. Yunoshimakan Discover Japanese culture while enjoying traditional hospitality and beautiful scenery Perched on a hill with panoramic views of Gero's hot spring area, you’ll find the stunning Yunoshimakan. Whether you prefer soaking in the serene atmosphere of the glorious open-air baths or the privacy of indoor options, your complimentary Yukata (bathrobe) awaits, as this ryokan offers a reinvigorating onsen experience tailored to your preferences. In the winter, Yunoshimakan is often covered by a blanket of snow, making the mountainous vistas and the Hida riverscape even more magical. The surrounding area also offers various cultural activities and events, enabling guests to engage in traditional Japanese customs, such as tea ceremonies, kimono dressing and more. Outside of relaxing at this luxurious ryokan, only a short 6-minute drive away, travellers can peruse the local Ideyu Morning Market or explore Gassho Village (‘Gero Onsen Gassho Mura’).

Here, you can peek inside the farmhouses, watch cultural reenactments or participate in classic folk art. Hamachidorinoyu Kaisyu Get a sense of comfort and serenity with traditional Japanese furniture If you have a deep connection with water, Hamachidorinoyu Kaisyu in Wakayama Prefecture is the ryokan for you.

As part of your journey in Wakayama, seize the opportunity to hike the ancient Kumano Kodo pilgrimage trails, a UNESCO World Heritage site – a two-hour drive, but worth the journey. Along the way, a visit to the remarkable Kumano Hayatama Taisha Shrine is a must. This architectural wonder graces the mouth of the Kumano-gawa River, where waters from the sacred Kii Mountains meet the sea. Continue your aquatic-themed hike by venturing into the Nachi Primeval Forest to marvel at Japan's tallest waterfall, Nachi Falls, standing at an impressive 436 ft.

They truly make the experience. The meals, particularly the dinner, were the best dining experience ever. Perfect in concept, quality and taste, execution, flow and service’. In between onsen soaks, visit the nearby Niseko Village to hit the slopes in style. Sui Suwako Combined with the simplicity of tatami, this Japanese room offers a stunning view of Lake Suwa Explore the enchanting Suwa region in Nagano Prefecture, affectionately known as 'the belly button of Japan' due to the mesmerising Lake Suwa located at the heart of Suwa City.
