Great location within easy walking distance to Parliament, museums, shopping, great restaurants. Eerily interesting, it feels like a jail, & the history is rather creepy, but great use for an awesome historic building. Staff was excellent, breakfast good, people from all over the world. I came for one night, stayed for two! C 10.0 Wonderful Chaz, Sep. 2015 Pros:What a wonderful experience! Sleeping in a REAL JAIL for three days was something I won't ever forget! It was so amazing to see how prisoners lived prior to 1970 in the Canadian Penal system. Cons:Gosh, there isn't much you can say negativity about this place -- except, perhaps, it would have been nice to have two pillows instead of one -- but it's JAIL, remember!?! :-) Location 75 Nicholas Street, Ottawa, ON What's nearby Shaw Centre219 m University of Ottawa0.5 km National War Memorial0.5 km Bytown Museum0.7 km Notre-Dame Cathedral Basilica0.8 km Parliament Hill0.8 km Peace Tower0.8 km Laurier House0.9 km National Gallery of Canada0.9 km Royal Canadian Mint1.1 km Supreme Court of Canada1.3 km Canadian Museum of Nature1.4 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
