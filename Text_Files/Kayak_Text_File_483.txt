Cons:Additional fees for parking pick up trucks and suvs A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Dec. 2016 Pros:Hotel was clean and staff was friendly. It is a good Central locarion close to many shops and bars. Cons:Hotel has no parking. We had to park in a lot accross the street. A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, May 2016 Pros:Key card didn't work, had to return to desk. Parking garage was under construction with no signs on where to park. Attendant made me move the car 3 times. Front desk failed to mention the parking problems I might encounter. At early checkout the clerk looked up from reading a paper, then resumed reading instead of serving me Cons:Tiny bathroom, small room A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Apr. 2016 Pros:clean, location was great as it was right off of Saint Catherine Cons:there was an excessive amount of loud banging from construction or something (that we were not advised of). particularly early morning too! A 9.4 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2015 Pros:For the price we paid we felt that it was too high because there was no breakfast included Cons:That there was no continental breakfast. There was only one functioning elevator which made the trips up & down too long A 7.6 Good Anonymous, Oct. 2014 Pros:It was modern, sleek, clean, and comfortable. Can speak French or English. Our King room had a sofa bed and fridge and LOTS of room to move around. Very spacious. Only a small window with no view, but the size of the room made up for it. Comfortable bed, but on the soft side. Had a small gym with TV although a few of the settings on the elliptical and bike didn't work for me. Centrally located between Mont Royal parc and Vieux Montreal where we wanted to walk to. Nothing special about the neighborhood, but it felt safe. Parking options were across the street in a separate uncovered lot or down the street in a covered garage. We chose across the street and it was fine although we had to load out in the rain and there is no cover for the cars, just street parking in front of the hotel. For the price in a big city, we found it more than adequate for the money. Cons:The resto lounge one the 2nd floor wasn't complete yet, so some of the offerings listed actually didn't exist yet. A 7.0 Good Anonymous, Sep. 2014 Pros:Awesome location, good sized room (king), powerful AC, quiet & comfortable. Cons:I arrived by motorcycle and the guy at front desk just stared at me like I was an alien. I asked about motorcycle parking and he told me to park in a lot around the corner, but I found out there's free street parking for motorcycles. And just being picky, the shampoo/moisturizer bottles were all opened by prior guest(s). A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2014 Pros:The location was great and there was inexpensive parking nearby. Cons:We had a couple of problems with our room and, while the staff was helpful, they didn't seem too concerned about any of it and didn't take any extra steps to make sure we were statisfied. D 6.6 Okay david, Feb. 2014 Pros:Location Cons:Small fridge Dirty floor.
