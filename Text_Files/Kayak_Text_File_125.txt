You can hear everything happening in this hotel. Terrible. Someone was walking above us on the third floor on super squeaky floor all the 3 nights we were there and it was super LOUD. In the morning cleaning lady starts vacuuming, you hear it as if she were doing it right next to you. People walking down the halls - you can hear everything they say in the middle of the night after hitting the bars. The mattress was really poor quality and uncomfortable. NO air conditioning. Even in May the room got really hot. Opening windows in the middle of Banff is not an option with all the people who party through the night. Parking is extra. No breakfast. For a price like this, no parking, and most importantly, NO SLEEP?! Terrible experience. Will never stay again and make sure to spread the word. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2016 Pros:We really liked the quaint atmosphere of the hotel. It was also great to be right in the heart of Banff next to great dining and nightlife. Great room for the price, especially if you are planning on staying out late at one of the night spots within walking distance. Cons:All in all it was good. The only thing that was just slightly inconvenient is that the parking is in the overnight public parkade behind the hotel. It's a small walk and not as secure as some places but really it's not an issue. If you plan to retire early then this might not be the place for you as its right on the hub of Banff's nightlife. But if you want the Banff experience this is the best place for the price. F 2.8 Poor flob, Aug. 2015 Pros:Really nothing. Other than being clean Cons:Parking was thro unsafe back street with unclear directions or markings. Did not look after clients as elevator broken and no staff hired to help with cases as seniors we had to carry cases down 3 flights A 4.5 Mediocre Anonymous, May 2015 Pros:Location Cons:Room K 8.5 Very good kamenitza2010, Apr. 2015 Pros:location and price, staff A 5.6 Fair Anonymous, Jun. 2014 Pros:Location Location 137 Banff Avenue, Banff, AB T1L 1A6 What's nearby Canada House Gallery104 m Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies176 m Canadian Ski Museum West230 m Banff Park Museum277 m Buffalo Nations Luxton Museum0.6 km Banff Cascades of Time Gardens0.6 km Bow Falls1.4 km Cave and Basin National Historic Site1.6 km Banff Springs Golf Club2.4 km Upper Hot Springs2.9 km Banff Gondola3.2 km Mount Norquay5.2 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 4:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
