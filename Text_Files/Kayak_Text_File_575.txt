J 8.0 Very good Jeannine, Mar. 2017 Pros:The location was very convenient and it was easy to get to any part of downtown. It was also pretty easy to use public transportation to get there from the airport which was my concern. There are plenty of restaurants and shops within a couple of blocks of the hotel. Another nice perk was a movie theater a couple of buildings over which was great. The staff was really pleasant and accommodating. The cleaning crew was amiable and checked in about when the room would be cleaned. I really appreciated not feeling rushed to get so the room could be cleaned. I would definitely like to stay there again. Cons:The room was a little small, but I think I could've upgraded if I chose. A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Jul. 2016 Pros:Great location to The Village A restaurant, a pub and a Starbucks are on property which is nice Cons:Desk staff seemed to be bothered by checking in. Beds are hard, pillows are too soft. Bathroom had long dark hair everywhere and I have a shaved head Room was small and was supposed to be King Size A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Mar. 2016 Pros:Pool and fitness center were nice. Cons:The room here was so small. We had four of us and it was very cramped. No walking room at ends of beds or between them. Smallest room I have ever seen. The temperature didn't work at all in the room and was way to hot or too cold. Toilet did not flush correctly and would have to call down to get a plunger. Not a comfortable room at all. B 7.4 Good bruce_lefevre, Aug. 2015 Pros:The concierge Alex was great on his suggestions for restaurants. He also gave excellent tips on the subway and street cars; this helped us get around town Nice location. Bathroom was spotless Cons:Rooms very small. Scuff marks on the walls Wifi disconnected frequently R 7.7 Good rl.bernicky, Aug. 2015 Pros:The bed was so comfy! And the towels were really nice too! Cons:I hated that people were allowed to smoke right at the door. That was disgusting! A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Aug. 2015 Pros:Great location. Cons:The rooms were small in my opinion. I stayed from a Friday-Sunday. The wifi was HORRIBLE. It would disconnect as I was using it all the time. The only time I had good service was near the pool or lobby. The lady at check in could also have been a bit friendlier. N 6.8 Okay Norah, Dec. 2014 Pros:Great central location Cons:I chose this hotel for the fitness centre but it was closed down for renovations and I was unable to workout, I was offered ryerse. University facilities but I'd have to bundle up walk a short distance outside and the weather was less then favorable and time was an issue Location 30 Carlton Street, Toronto, ON M5B 2E9 What's nearby Toronto Eaton Centre0.8 km Nathan Phillips Square1 km University of Toronto1.2 km Art Gallery Of Ontario1.3 km Royal Ontario Museum1.3 km Hockey Hall of Fame1.6 km St. Lawrence Market1.6 km Kensington Market1.7 km Princess of Wales Theatre1.7 km TIFF Bell Lightbox1.8 km Scotiabank Arena2 km Distillery District2.1 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 4:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
