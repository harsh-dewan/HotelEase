One of the morning shuttle drivers was rude and the shuttle often would barely stop at the hotel to pick up passengers. Very easy to miss it and then you have to wait 30 minutes to catch another one. no concierge on staff . Overall, the facilities were nice. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, May 2023 Loud noise. No one did anything about it. Adjacent room i could hear and feel the person snoring. A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Dec. 2019 Cons:Couldn’t sleep due to being to close to airport J 8.5 Very good Jessica, Jul. 2019 Pros:Clean rooms, good amenities. Cons:The biggest issue was the location by the airport. You can hear the airplanes all day/night long. A 10.0 Wonderful Alexander, May 2019 Pros:Friendly staff, well-stocked pantry (lounge) and a pretty good breakfast selection at the pantry (lounge.) Cons:Confusing parking situation and nowhere to stop your car for registration/check-in. M 10.0 Wonderful Mary, Jan. 2018 Cons:Everything was perfect A 7.7 Good Anonymous, Jul. 2017 Pros:Newly refurbished hotel Starbucks, Japanese and Indian restaurant on site 20 mins from city center Bathroom was a decent size Cons:Tiny room for a Queen+queen sofa bed Room was not prepared for 4.

A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2017 Pros:The room was so spacious and my one bed room included a full comfortable couch. Faucets and showers, air conditioner etc. were all in easy to use and in working order. The remodeled room was beautiful and modern. Staff at the front desk were very helpful and pleasant. Cons:Was hesitant to drive into what appeared to be a paid parking area just to check in. But it stated first 30 minutes were free. Looks like the immediate surroundings of the hotel are in transition, not a place I'd like to go to take a walk.
