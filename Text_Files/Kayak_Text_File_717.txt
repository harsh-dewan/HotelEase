I didn't have plans, and was on a budget YWCA was the most affordable and easiest to book. The room was very clean, I checked for dusty on head boards and the whole thing. I had a double written rim with a bathroom and shower in it and was very happy. The location is perfect, and they offer under ground parking. Take it! Cons:due to the age of the building, security and such, there are some quirks to the building. Need to use a separate key for the elevator, but really it was all really easy and the staff was great. I appreciated the security features. A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:Great location, bed was comfy. Cons:Shared bathroom with the adjacent room had no way to know when someone was in. There should be a sliding sign or a light or something to tell.
