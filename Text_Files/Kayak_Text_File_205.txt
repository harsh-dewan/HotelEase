Cons:Some confusion when checking in meant I thought we were getting $25 per person food credit a night not $25 a room credit. This lead towards an unpleasant surprise when checking out. K 10.0 Wonderful Kate, Feb. 2020 Pros:Club staff and amenities was fabulous! Cons:nothing N 4.5 Mediocre N, Jan. 2020 Pros:Location was good. Cons:Service was terrible. Facilities were poorly maintained. Facilities were terrible. Food options were terrible. C 10.0 Wonderful Corey, Mar. 2019 Pros:very courteous and attentive staff A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Dec. 2019 Pros:Bed was comfy Cons:Valet parking was terrible, check in process was slow and laboured. B 6.8 Okay Brad, Apr. 2018 Pros:The woman, Madeline, who checked me in and out was exceptional and is the example for all of the other associates there. She made sure at check-in that I was comfortable, she asked about my flight in, and made sure that I had a map and was situated well to use the PATH and other means to get around Toronto. The hotel was clean and modernized and room service was excellent. The room service associates were exceedingly polite and friendly. Cons:I arrived early Sunday and was in conference all day and jetlagged. I couldn't wait to put in a long rest since I wasn't in conference that morning. I put out the "Do Not Disturb" and latched the door. At about 9:00 am Monday morning housekeeping opened the door. When I got up to see what was going on I told her no services at this time. She said she was having problems with the door because the RFID was flashing yellow (which was explained to me the yellow light meant that the latch was on. She persisted until I let her in. She cleaned the bathroom and left, but my day was just going to have to start I guess. As I saw her throughout my stay she was not the most polite. Very terse "Hello"s, if at all. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Pros:Security lady was very nice although we were a loud bunch! Cons:The room was rather tight for a "suite" A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jan. 2018 Pros:Clean and comfy room with a great view of the City of Toronto. Loved the "Club" experience on top of the Sheraton ... it was worth the extra cost. It was great to be able to leave your coat and boots behind and go underground shopping! A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Dec. 2017 Pros:Everything was great from the moment we walked in to the moment we left. Being in the downtown area they did the best to make there guests free at home. Cons:Besides the fire alarm that went off in the evening. That was somethings that wasn’t in our control. everything was good. No complaints. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:I ask for and receive one of the best views in the city. As my first rip outside my country the staff was extremely welcoming & friendly.
