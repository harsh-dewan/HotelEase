Room darkening blinds Cons:hard bed, tilty bathroom shelf A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Jan. 2016 Pros:The hotel was in a great location, we didn't have to drive anywhere, a tip- valet parking is $26 or one street over it was $9 all day/night underground.. staff was very friendly and rooms where pretty clean (just don't use the dishes provided, I used a glass and left it in the sink and after the cleaner left in the morning the dirty cup was put back on the shelf with the clean ones with coffee still in the bottom and there was no soap to wash it myself) Only complaints, we stayed for 4 days and for the first 2 we didn't have a key to our room because the door wasn't working, so we had to have staff take us upstairs every time we came in. The breakfast was terrible, don't waste $10 on hard muffins,apples and begals. And the walls were a little thin, we could hear the room beside us talking and coughing. All in all we have stayed in pretty bad hotels but this doesnt make the list and we wouldn't not recommend it. R 6.8 Okay redroses17, Aug. 2015 Pros:• Hotel was in walking distance of most attractions (Chinatown, Old Montreal, Complexe Desjardins, metro) but not in the center of the hustle and bustle of downtown • Decor was modern and visually interesting • Was comfortable to stay in for multiple nights • Beautiful terrace to enjoy Cons:• When our shower wasn't working properly, it took a little convincing before the receptionist agreed to send up a maintenance person • Dusty (bad for allergies) • Gym is very small (only a couple machines) Location 01 Rene-Levesque Blvd. Est, Montreal, QC H2X 3Z5 What's nearby Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes0.6 km Théâtre Saint-Denis0.6 km Place Jacques-Cartier0.7 km Vieux-Port de Montréal0.8 km Musée Pointe-à-Callière0.9 km Square Saint-Louis1.1 km Cathédrale Marie-Reine-du-Monde1.2 km McGill University1.3 km Centre Bell1.5 km Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal1.8 km Parc du Mont-Royal2.1 km Parc Jean-Drapeau2.2 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 12:00 PM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
