The pillows and mattresses need to be replaced as they are uncomfortable and worn out. The firm pillows were anything but and the bed was lumpy. Also our ice machine was broken on our floor. Liked having the restaurant next door although they have a limited menu. Having a coffee maker, refrigerator, microwave and safe in room was very nice. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Pros:The room was clean and the staff helpful, going out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed (e.g. providing extra towels and soap for our group). Cons:Elevators are a little old and slow, but not much to complain about at this hotel, especially for the price tag. A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Oct. 2016 Pros:Close to peoplease I know. Front desk staff very helpful and professional in person. Cons:Sketchy area after dark. We left a cherished item in the room and the staff was not helpful at all. A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:Reasonably close to downtown and the space needle. The restaurant was okay, though breakfast was too expensive. Staff were very professional. Cons:Doesn't include free breakfast, even though the Holiday Inn Express that's right behind it does. Bedsheets don't fully cover the queen beds. Free Wi-Fi was so slow as to be worthless (100kB/s). A 5.7 Fair Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:Cheaper parking Cons:Not easy walking area, near a major highway. Have to walk a few blocks to get away from highway to get towards downtown. Not a lot of restaurants in the near vacinity. Did not feel like a heat area, too congested in that area Location 211 Dexter Avenue North, Seattle, WA 98109 What's nearby Museum of Pop Culture0.4 km Space Needle0.5 km Chihuly Garden and Glass0.6 km Seattle Center0.7 km Museum of History and Industry1 km Olympic Sculpture Park1.1 km Pike Place Market1.1 km Benaroya Hall1.4 km Seattle Art Museum1.4 km Seattle Public Library-Central Library1.7 km Kerry Park1.7 km Seattle Waterfront1.7 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 12:00 PM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
