Cons:Bit of a funny smell in our bathroom. Mattress was lopsided. A 4.8 Mediocre Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Cons:Because the rooms are close to bar, It is very noisy, The exit signs are very confusing, leading you to the emergency exit outside of the building, no clear sign to go to elevator. A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Pros:The location on Granville is great, but right next to a nightclub that kept you awake all night with rumbling throughout all of the walls the entire night. Cons:The nightclub right next door to the hotel, Twelve West, kept us up the entire couple of nights during the weekend with rumblings and sound through all walls the entire night. J 4.8 Mediocre Jackson, May 2016 Pros:Location Cons:Got stuck in the elevator almost right away, then asked for extra towels that never came and there were huge coffee stains over the duve cover. Again just all in all not worth the price for one night. A 5.7 Fair Anonymous, May 2016 Pros:What makes this place so odd are the number of things where the reality doesn't m A 6.8 Okay Anonymous, Apr. 2016 Cons:I had a death in the family, and I was not very happy that you would not let me change the reservation. I was told that my mom's passing was "not extenuating circumstances" and so you guys would not be able to make any changes or to refund the money. I thought that was very unsympathetic to say the least. So I stayed for 1 night while paying for 2 nights. Not very compassionate of you. I will now think twice before using your services. A 4.8 Mediocre Anonymous, Apr. 2016 Pros:Pets allowed Cons:The room looked clean but once we uncovered the sheets there was hair and crumbs. The bedsheets weren't changed, good thing the cleaning lady was just outside the door so I ended up changing the sheets myself. I told staff but they didn't do anything about it. Tip: Don't book through a website. I paid $280 for a two night stay. They took out $50 or $60 on top of the $280. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Feb. 2016 Pros:big bathrooms comfortable beds Cons:I found the hallways a little confusing S 6.0 Okay Seymour, Jan. 2016 Cons:No central heating so a space heater that was too hot or too cold and dried out the air in the room Location 1221 Granville Street, Vancouver, BC V6Z 1M6 What's nearby Orpheum Theatre0.6 km Granville Island Public Market0.8 km Vancouver Art Gallery0.8 km Granville Island0.9 km Bill Reid Gallery of Northwest Coast Art1 km Inukshuk1.5 km Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden1.7 km TELUS World of Science1.7 km Canada Place1.7 km Chinatown1.8 km Kitsilano Beach1.9 km Vancouver Aquarium2.7 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 4:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
