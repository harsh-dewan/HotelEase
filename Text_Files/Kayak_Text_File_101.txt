Kitchenette was very well equipped. Four of us in two rooms all had an excellent night’s sleep in very comfortable beds. A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Mar. 2019 Pros:Good location- nice little hike right behind the hotel. Easy parking. Free wifi Cons:It’s very very outdated and shows it’s age. Didn’t want to think about what was on that green ancient carpet A 5.7 Fair Anonymous, Jan. 2019 Cons:Was not happy about having to park down the street and around a corner because there was no parking when we returned to the hotel at 2am A 4.2 Mediocre Anonymous, Sep. 2018 Pros:The king size bed was nice, small bathroom. Cons:The lady at reception was not very accommodating, not rude but definitely not helpful. I don’t think she likes her job. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Dec. 2017 Pros:Great location and reasonable price Cons:Very rude staff, kicked groups of people relaxing in the hot tub out early for no particular reason. Front desk was not courteous on checkout. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:Very comfortable rooms and beds, right price Cons:Sauna not clean and 2 of the 3 hot tubs were lukewarm, but one hot tub good and hot! Great on a Sunday night but with bigger crowd would have been a problem A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:All we needed was a clean room and a comfy bed for one night stay during our 2 days skiing and boarding on Marmot Basin. This hotel provided both. Clean room, bathroom and bad. Cons:Lack of microwave. Would be nice to have one. Noisy guests. This hotel mainly used by families and skiers which means more coming and going during the evening which comes with more noise. People are disrespectful and do not care about the other guests' rest. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jul. 2017 Pros:We were traveling with several other family members and had booked 3 rooms at the Lobstick Lodge. The hotel had all our rooms together which was very nice. A great place to stay. We actually walked into town to avoid the hassles of parking, it wasn't far. D 6.8 Okay Daniel, Feb. 2017 Pros:The Hottub Cons:The Hottub was not open when it says it would be K 9.1 Wonderful KastleDx, Jan. 2017 Pros:The bed was really comfy, the sheets were soft, the restaurant was great and the toiletries provided smelled nice and were clearly of a great quality. It was nice that they were able to get us in earlier than check in time. Cons:The wall sockets were too high in the room, prompting us to find a creative way of stacking the kettle in order to boil water. The walls were too thin, we could hear other guests talking, not shouting, in the adjacent rooms. There was also a weird dip in the floor of the hallway.
