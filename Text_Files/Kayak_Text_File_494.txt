I said that is unacceptable a warm shower is a necessity! Manager never apologized offered the second morning after day freezing shower to tote my stuff across the courtyard to use a shower In another room .. temporarily.l.. I would have preferred a new room a small I don't wanna lug my stuff to another room when I need a shower .. I want to shower in my own room ! The shower in my room also didn't drain and spit up sludge .. trying to find extra towels was also a task .. I was told to go find the cleaning lady .. not sure why this is my problem to deal with ? I'm paying to stay in a place I should not have to track down a cleaning lady .. at checkout the manager refused to discount my stay saying hot water tank happens and was out of his control !! He went and charged my visa previous evening when upon arrival I asked if I could pay cash at checkout and the front desk agreed .. worst customer service I have ever received ! I don't think a warm shower is to much to ask for ?? Would not recommend this place to a homeless person for free!!!
