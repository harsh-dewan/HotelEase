Lots to see in area. Pedestrain friendly location. Rooms immaculate and well refurbished Century Property. This is our new goto place when in town. Cons:Just beware property is situated on pedestrain thoroughfare with public benches right out front that are normally occupied by "happy" street people. Friendly and safe though. Also examine map to find closest underground city parking (cheapest) before arrival. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2018 Pros:Not your national chain hotel but has character. Well maintained and room and bathroom very clean. Fantastic location. Cons:No complaints. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Dec. 2017 Cons:Hotel entrance was a door between two sex related shops/venues. I was told we would be sharing one common bathroom for all the third floor. The room had an old linen appearance, dark, dirty- not at as I was led to believe from the booking.com website. I was tired, with family(mom, kids, husband), in a foreign country, and even then I could not sleep in this place. It was that bad. My husband luckily was able to find a true restful stay elsewhere but after a lot of inconvenience. When I asked for a refund since we would not be staying, the gentleman told me he could not refund me.
