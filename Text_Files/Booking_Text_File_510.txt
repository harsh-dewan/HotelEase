My room 1905 was lovely although very small. I kept bruising my hip on the tv cabinet going to the wardrobe (the desk could be moved slightly towards the bathroom door to give a couple of inches more space for walking through). The domestic staff were a delight on my floor and always had my room done before I came back from breakfast. I loved that. Dining room staff were always charming and obliging.
