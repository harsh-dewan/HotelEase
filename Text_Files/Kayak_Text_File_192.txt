A 3.9 Poor Anonymous, Aug. 2021 good location no fridge in room no place to have all trash picked up A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, May 2017 Pros:Location - very close to the conference center, easy access to other amenities Staff - very helpful and friendly Breakfast - delicious with a good selection of healthy choices (Fresh fruit, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, toast etc..). My son loved the bunk bed. Cons:The bed wasn't great - it was easy to feel the springs in the mattress and there wasn't a huge amount of support. I switched rooms the last night and the second was a bit of an improvement mostly because it had a thicker mattress pad. The rooms are small so not suitable for lounging in but it met our needs. A 6.8 Okay Anonymous, Oct. 2016 Pros:The staff were very polite and helpful The wifi connection worked well Continental breakfask was included Cons:Very few TV channels A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2016 Pros:I stayed at travel lodge with a couple friends and the location was awesome. Hotel was clean and in good condition. Breakfast was delicious. Cons:Had a room with a bunk bed and the top bed was a bit small and quite firm. Otherwise really enjoyed my stay. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2016 Pros:Surprisingly nice quality for the price and brand of hotel Cons:Everything was great A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Oct. 2015 Cons:The room with a queen and pull-out sofa was not large enough to handle the sofa extension. No room for maneuvering. F 2.5 Poor Frangy., Sep. 2015 Pros:I only like the location. Cons:The receptionists were rude and not professional at all.
