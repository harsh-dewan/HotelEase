Cons:Breakfast could be much better. Not many options. You can pay for a full breakfast for 5 dollars, but i would have been happy with just better offerings. More fruit, and muffins, and bagels with maybe cream cheese. The location isnt the best, because there is not a LOT around. Not many places to just walk to.
