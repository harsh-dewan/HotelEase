R 10.0 Wonderful Richard, Aug. 2018 Pros:Friendly staff, good breakfast, clean rooms. Would certainly stay here again. A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Aug. 2018 Pros:The bed is very comfortable and I liked the water pressure in the shower. Cons:The shampoo and conditioner were not very good and the breakfast was so-so. Not a lot of non-grain options except the eggs which were not very good. L 7.4 Good Linda, Nov. 2017 Pros:Friendly staff. Comfortable bed. Good shower A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:Free wifi without a password. The room was separated, living space in one room with the couch and tv, then bedroom in a separate space with just a bed and nightstands. Cons:Pool is outside so not accessible during winter. Hot tub was inaccessible because walkways were not shovelled. Tv had limited channels, the majority of which being American news networks which are horribly depressing at the best of times. A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Apr. 2016 Pros:Clean rooms & comfortable beds & pillows. Friendly, responsive staff! Cons:The breakfast is mediocre at best. Eggs are not freshly boiled, they are older eggs that are pre-packaged & rubbery. Other breakfast items are mostly refined carbohydrates and sugar. Plain oatmeal was OK. Plain yogourt without sugar added would be preferred. More fresh fruit would be nice & muffins that are nutritious & not loaded with sugar would be better, too. Hey, if you feed your guests "real food", then we may live longer and be able to come to your hotel again. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2015 Pros:The bed was very comfortable as was the sofa. The staff were very nice. It was clean. Cons:The smell of febreeze was overpowering when I first entered the room. The shower was tiny but the water pressure was good.
