Room service and food exceeded expectations and was high quality. Cons:Nothing noted. A 6.8 Okay Anonymous, Nov. 2016 Pros:Walking distance from Rogers Place (15 min) Good value Nice staff Comfortable bed Cons:Dated lobbies/rooms seem slightly dingy This hotel wants to be a super nice but doesn't seem like they want to invest in the accommodations A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Dec. 2015 Pros:Great place to stay for our wedding night. Comfy bed, recently remodeled room with great facilities. We had dinnew at LA Ronde and it was fantastic! Cons:Got woken up at 3am to woman banging on a door three doors down yelling "is she in there?!?!" Commotion lasted 30 minutes A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, May 2015 Pros:Staff helpful Cons:Paying $15.95 for parking. A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Apr. 2015 Pros:Staff were very courteous under obviously trying circumstances. Cons:It's not the hotel's fault but I wish we had known that it was full of guests attending a giant Rave party down the street. The room was nice but the activity in the neighbourhood and in the halls all night was disturbing to say the least. It might be wise to check on events going on at the nearby Shaw convention center when booking -especially if they involve large crowds and open drug use. A 7.7 Good Anonymous, Nov. 2014 Pros:Very accommodating. Helpful staff.
