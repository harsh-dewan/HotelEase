Beds are fairly comfortable Cons:They seem to have trouble with shuttles. Not adequate space for amount of people and luggage. The green carpets really need to be replaced. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Dec. 2018 Pros:shuttle included to and from the airport Cons:Not a thing! J 10.0 Wonderful Jaclyn, Nov. 2018 Pros:Friendly staff. Cons:Parking lot is a little dark. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Sep. 2018 Pros:Proximity to the airport Cons:There was a wedding/event on the first floor the night of our stay. Our room was on the third floor. We heard music and felt vibrations from the bass late into the night and couldn't get to sleep. The front desk did nothing. For a hotel that advertises its proximity to the airport, this was ridiculous for travellers that need to wake up early for morning flights. I heard other guests complaining in the hallway as well. I don't expect much, but I'd have been better off at a Motel 6 or in my car than this. I e-mailed a complaint directly to the hotel afterward but got no response. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Aug. 2018 Pros:Beds are comfy, bathroom was kept clean, location was near tim hortons, McDonalds, and shopping centers which was great Cons:The cleaning staff knocked on our door about 3 times per day between 9am - 11am before we left the room to see if they could clean, could hear vacuum in hall by 9am, We weren't allowed to check in until 3pm, but then people walked up right after us and checked in no problem, I understand we may have been assigned a room but I'm sure there could have been a way to accommodate us as I had driven through the night to get there and wanted to sleep before my festival which started at 3. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2018 Pros:Good amenities and value. A 9.4 Wonderful Anonymous, May 2018 Pros:I like location very good hotel Cons:But I like breakfast but breakfast is not upto that mark A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Feb. 2018 Pros:I was upgraded from a queen size room to a king size room for free, so there was plenty of space and the room itself had a nice modern finish. Cons:One week later I haven’t received my $50 damage deposit back yet and I don’t have a Canadian number from which to call them. Could kayak contact them on my behalf? A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Pros:They have a great stay,park and fly package.
