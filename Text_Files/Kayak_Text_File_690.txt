I'm checking the prices now because I want to go back, and, wow, did I get a deal. Wish I could afford to return. Cons:Literally nothing. Like, maybe a Nespresso machine in the room? It was phenomenal. Even the LPs in my room were perfect for me. It's like they knew. THEY KNEW. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Apr. 2018 Pros:Overall it was nice! The room was nice, upscale and a bit swanky, but efficient. Staff was lovely and friendly. Cons:They just opened so the bar nor restaurant were open, which was unfortunate. There was a bit of construction going on too. The room was not that insulated for sound and could hear hallway and outside noise.
