As our meals were sent to our rooms for COVID reasons. I waited till lunch time for it Never delivered. A 8.2 Very good Anonymous, Apr. 2019 Pros:No breakfast other than Starbucks R 10.0 Wonderful Rikesia, Jan. 2019 Pros:I had a little issue on the front end with adding one of my Traveler’s to our room so they could check in prior to the person booking the room but front desk person Ali made up for the error and gave the best customer service I have exp. with a hotel Cons:I’m not sure other than human error. We really had a great time overall and the restaurant Turtle’s Neck gave us an awesome breakfast experience. Then we got shuttle to airport for the entire group with lots of luggage in one trip for free was the icing on the cake to make our departure a smooth process. D 8.0 Very good David, Jan. 2019 Pros:Clean room, night staff were excellent. Morning woman, not great. Cons:Breakfast not included if booked via Expedia. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Feb. 2018 Pros:The warm cookies YUMMY comfy beds clean rooms Cons:The change room for the pool was a large washroom. People in the gym can watch the kids in the pool A 3.4 Poor Anonymous, Jun. 2017 Pros:Rooms newly renovated. Cons:Everything other than the room was in a state of complete chaos. The walls were torn off, there was exposed mould, there were exposed wires... crazy. I've never seen anything like it in an open for business.. business. In the room, it looks like they got an awful contractor. Everything was nice, but just slightly off. e.g. the heat would not turn off, the shower door rolled open on its own, etc. A 7.7 Good Anonymous, May 2016 Pros:Location, comfort and cleanliness, good sleep were all quite satisfactory. Cons:Prakag at the front desk seemed to be very deceptive and maliciously misleading in his information to my wife and I. We had a confirmed reservation for May 4th. 2016. However he directed us to phone the reservation agent to cancel our reservation for that date, because he was unable to guarantee it. For reasons unknown to us he was apparently deliberately and maliciously attempting to mislead us. Fortunately another hotel staff upon checking out on April 20th confirmed our reservation for May 4th, but at a higher rate. We were terribly disappointed. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:Very affordable and better then most hotels that cost double the price! Cons:Clean, attractive looking hotel with a great price very comfortable stay would recommend. Only stayed for layover stole in Toronto but couldn't ask for any better S 9.4 Wonderful spamathon2010, Aug. 2015 Pros:Nothing special but a good place to sleep. No complaints. Cons:Nothing special but a good place to sleep. J 5.7 Fair jezzicarabbit_81, Jun. 2015 Pros:I have never had to pay an additional fee to park at the location I am already paying to stay at. absolutely ridiculous! and no shampoo or conditioner in the rooms. you will have to pay for every extra little thing you will need if you stay here. and my air conditioner didn't work. they sent someone to fix it who managed to turn on the fan to blow the hot air around. the hall was cooler than my room. very uncomfortable stay.
