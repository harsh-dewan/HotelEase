Top countries United Arab Emirates VIP Hostel - Females Only - “Comfy beds, good location, neat and clean, easy access to metro, very kind and helpful owner. Most of all I felt safe like I am at home. Go girls get it.” Australia Crowne Plaza Surfers Paradise, an IHG Hotel - “I really like that the room service is 24/7. The food was fantastic and very fast to arrive. The parking was easy, staff were lovely, rooms were sensational. Bedding very comfortable and the bath tub was perfect.” Brazil Casa Acquamarina - “What we appreciated most is the philosophy of the owner who did not build a cash-machine (as there are regrettably several in Atins), but decided to respect his environment and the "root" spirit of the village. No clim, no swimming pool but he did this without compromising confort and you feel very comfortable there. The breakfast which is partly done with products of the garden is clearly the best we had in our stay in Brazil. Hope this pousada will continue long !” Canada Saintlo Ottawa Jail Hostel - “Interesting tour of the jail! Room dormitory give an affordable option and single bed cells are pretty cool and give a safe option for people that needs more privacy, I liked both.” Germany Kloster Malgarten - “It’s simply amazing!
