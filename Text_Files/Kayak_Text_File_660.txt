L 8.0 Very good Luca, Apr. 2017 Pros:Hotel room, position Cons:Breakfast could be better. Parking not easy A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:Great location, close to Place d'Armes metro station, walkable to Vieux Montreal. Modern rooms with great windows, nice bathroom, and comfortable bed. Cons:The included breakfast was a low-point in the stay. The hotel, like most of the city while we were there, was under construction, which diminished the overall feel and appearance. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2014 Pros:The location cannot be beat, close to the Vieux Port, the Bell Centre, St. Catherine's Street, the Quartier Latin, as well as public transportation. The price is excellent. Clean, large rooms, with comfortable beds. Cons:The breakfast was adequate, especially considering it is included, but could definitely have been better.
