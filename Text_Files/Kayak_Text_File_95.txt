The ratings had three stars so I fell for it. Cons:Pretty much everything. Lowest price on the list I generated, but It is really a terrible place and I'm not high maintenance.. The room smelled of years of cigarette smoke, the internet and tv didnt work, the cold water tap in the bathroom sink didn't work. Cigarette burns all over the carpet. If my wife or kids had been with me, we would have been out of there the second after we checked in.
