There are fabulous views over Tenerife and the surrounding islands from the cable car that takes you up. However, most visitors flock to the island for its beaches. The most exclusive area is Costa Adeje, home to most 5-star hotels in Tenerife. It also houses Aqualand waterpark with waterslides, pools and a dolphinarium, while next door Playa de las Americas boasts Siam Park ‚Äì Europe‚Äôs largest waterpark. This resort is the island‚Äôs party capital and features a large number of Tenerife hotels with swimming pools, and a wealth of bars and restaurants. Adjoining Los Cristianos also has a long, sandy beach. The southern Tenerife beaches are actually artificial, made from white sand imported from the Sahara Desert, because the natural ones are black sand. Tenerife resorts with just such a beach include Puerto de la Cruz and Los Gigantes, which is dramatically sheltered by sheer cliffs. The capital ‚Äì Santa Cruz ‚Äì is the arrival point for ferries from the other Canaries and has a huge, annual carnival.
