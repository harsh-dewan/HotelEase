We booked through GetARoom and they completely messed up our reservation (booked us 1 room instead of 2). The staff was very understanding, checked us in 2 hours early so that we had time to get ready for a wedding, and supported us 100% when I contacted GetARoom for a refund. They really went above and beyond. The bed was really comfy too! A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Apr. 2016 Pros:The rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, great room service & housekeeping.

Cons:The hair dryer in he room didn't work, and had to be replaced. The maintenance man was great though, and replaced it right away. Apparently, this is a fairly common occurrence. My recommendation is, invest in better quality hair dryers. L 10.0 Wonderful lonnie3997, Apr. 2015 Pros:The best part of the hotel was how funny their pens, note pads, "do not disturb" signs, etc. were. The room was older with a cigarette burn on the toilet and a chip in the sink, but the beds are comfortable and triple sheeted so I had no complaints.
