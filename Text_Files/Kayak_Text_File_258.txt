Cons:Didn't realize it's more of a motel with separate buildings to get to for the rooms. A 5.1 Fair Anonymous, Mar. 2017 Pros:Location convenient due to the event we were attending Staff were all friendly rooms were comfortable Cons:Dated The finish of the rooms were rough Bathroom floor tiles broken. Chalking in the shower area poorly done Sink had several flaws No HI DEF tv really spoils the picture without it Parking lot a Was atrocious pot holes and mis-shaped Area around the hvac was open to the elements not sealed The door had gaps and allowed air and noise into the room G 6.0 Okay george, Aug. 2015 Pros:Very solid Hotel, with no major weaknesses. We were an older building fronting the highway, rather than the river. Beds were good, bathroom and shower were good. Everything was in good working order, good value and very nice staff. Office and restaurant area are very nice, with outside patio and pool. D 10.0 Wonderful dowaho, Jun. 2015 Pros:Having a restaurant within the facilities. Having units away from the busy Prince of wales Drive to reduce road noise. Allowing us two hours stay over after 11am checkout to get ready for a family memorial service. Cons:Just thought t might spark more interest if the attached restaurant was advertised in each unit book of local facilities available.
