The vibe: Fabulously pink with a bright, tropical attitude. What we love: Right next to the wildlife habitat is the kind of pool you could spend the majority of your Vegas trip at (as long as you don't come in winter when it's closed). Not only are there palms trees and lush greenery everywhere your eyes can see, but the main pool is interconnected to lagoon areas, a waterslide and cascading waterfall. Factor in the hot tubs and modest-sized deck (with lounge chairs that get claimed quickly, so you may want to spring for a cabana here) and you've got a chill vibe that's more friendly than clubby as well as fun for all ages. It's hard to do better location-wise than the Flamingo. The rooms are reasonably priced especially considering you're steps away from elite resorts and attractions like the Fountains at Bellagio, the High Roller observation wheel, the Eiffel Tower Viewing Deck and The Forum Shops at Caesars Palace. Insider tips: Snap a photo at Bugsy Siegel's memorial. It's located between the wildlife habitat and the pools, just outside the wedding chapel. Look for a stone pillar and bronze plaque set amid a beautiful garden. This marks the site of the original hotel (knocked down in 1993). Don't wait to check out. When lines are long, you'll often spot a roving ambassador at the Flamingo with the ability to check you out on an iPad. The only down side: You won't get your receipt immediately. You'll have to wait until it's emailed to you. Use the Flamingo's north doors when you're going to The LINQ Promenade. Otherwise you'll have to walk out onto the Strip. Trust us, you want to avoid the river of people that flows along the sidewalk here. Nothing beats the direct access you have from the resort's side entrance. Good to know: The Flamingo opened in 1946. We're telling you this for two reasons. One: That's really cool historically. Two: Despite the age of the building, you'll find that many of the rooms and amenities are newly upgraded and perfectly contemporary. Remember how we mentioned that this hotel was built in 1946.well, being constructed back then means that you'll find low ceilings in the casino compared to those at newer properties. If you start to feel overwhelmed or closed in while gambling, stroll over to the Margaritaville Casino. The doors are open to the Strip so it feels roomier and the ventilation is better. The Flamingo has a dedicated seven-story parking garage - used for both valet and self-parking. On busy weekends it can fill up. When this happens, valet parking may be restricted to registered guests and Caesars Rewards club members. What shows and concerts are playing at the Flamingo?: Shows playing at the Flamingo include: RuPaul's Drag Race Live!, Piff the Magic Dragon, X Burlesque, and Wayne Newton: Up Close and Personal. What is there to do at the Flamingo?: There is the Wildlife Habitat filled with the hotel's signature flamingos. There is also the neighboring LINQ Promenade, filled with shops and restaurants and the High Roller Observation Wheel. What makes the Flamingo unique?: Few resorts on the Las Vegas Strip have a mascot to compliment their name, let alone a flock. But the Flamingo has an abundance of, well, flamingos located in their Wildlife Habitat.
