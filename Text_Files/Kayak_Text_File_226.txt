The vibe: Fun-for-all-ages atmosphere, no frills accommodations, faux castle theme What we love: There's an obvious reason why people choose to stay at Exalibur: it's cheap. And even with the resort fee, you'll still save a bundle. Although this gigantic white castle with spires of bright red, blue and gold doesn't quite hearken back to the Middle Ages, you'll love tweeting out from the drawbridge or the Fun Dungeon (just rein in your "50 Shades of Grey" fantasies because this is an arcade and carnival-style midway for families). Insider tips: Excalibur is connected to Luxor (which in turn is connected to Mandalay Bay) by an enclosed passage. This is great on summer days when - trust us - you don't want to walk out in the sweltering heat. If you've got a car, you should access Excalibur from Frank Sinatra Drive and not directly from the Strip. This will take you behind the resort to its three-story self-parking garage. You'll then walk across the road (Luxor Drive) and enter through the rear entrance. Good to know: Don't expect the rooms at Excalibur to have medieval décor. The furnishings are traditional - no garderobes here (and thank god because if you know what a garderobe is you don't want one). Also, if you smoke in a non-smoking room, there will be a pretty big fine at checkout. Save yourself the trouble and light up in designated smoking areas throughout the casino. What shows and concerts are playing at the Excalibur?: Shows playing at the Excalibur include: Tournament of Kings, Mac King Comedy Magic Show, Australia's Thunder From Down Under, and Austrailian Bee Gees. What is there to do at the Excalibur?: Excalibur offers a family-friendly Fun Dungeon Carnival Arcade, the 4D Ultimate Experience, numerous restaurants, casino games, and an outdoor pool. What makes the Excalibur unique?: Shaped like a castle, at the south end of the Strip, Excalibur has a fun-for-all-ages atmosphere that mixes medieval style with modern conveniences.
