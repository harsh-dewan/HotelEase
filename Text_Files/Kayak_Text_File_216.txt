It is convenient, walking distance to restaurants, grocery, stores. Cons:The room is very small and compact. The bathroom is even worse than the one in a cabin of a ship. No way to stretch your arms in such small space. The WiFi was such a hassle, not stable and each user name can only used for one device for 24 hours. The king bed was combined with two mattresses.
