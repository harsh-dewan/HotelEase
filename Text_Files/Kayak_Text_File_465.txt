The only major concern was that the room reeked of cannabis. I don't use it but luckily I kind of like the smell. It was pretty strong until I used a fan to push most of it out the window. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Nov. 2016 Pros:Nothing Cons:I accidentally booked in the wrong city and they would not reimburse.... Horrible way to run a business.
