Cons:If you drive into town with a larger vehicle, you will not be able to park onsite. Parking in other locations becomes costly. N 2.0 Poor nate, Aug. 2014 Pros:Nothing, I didnt stay there. They gave my room to someone else. Cons:Hilton booked me in an oversold hotel. After traveling 11 hours I showed up and they said i had no room! I paid for 2 nights in advance and it was PAID for. How could Hilton do this? I am a HiltonHonors member, being a member doesn't mean much to them, where is the loyalty? They gave my paid for room to someone else and told me to go find another hotel.
