The vibe: Bargain accommodations with a dash of Mardi Gras spirit in a near central Strip location. What we love: Everyone wants to be near the center of the Strip. By staying at Harrah's you won't pay through the nose for that privilege. Wait, do we actually have to elaborate on that? OK, so you can walk over to The LINQ Promenade next door and get on the High Roller Observation Wheel. Eat, drink and shop like a Roman across the street at Caesars Palace. Mosey over to The Mirage where dolphins swim and a volcano erupts nightly. Because this is just the tip of the iceberg, that's enough…we're done talking about how ideal Harrah's location is. While we don't love eating fried bologna sandwiches (of course, we respect your desire to eat them), we do adore Toby Keith's I Love This Bar and Grill. Named for one of the country superstar's hit singles, this joint is bursting at the seams with live music, dancing, beer and big portions of good ol' home-style food. As far as buffets go, Flavors is worth a visit. Instead of waxing poetic about the prime rib and crab legs, let's skip right to the good stuff. The dessert station. This one is stocked with things you don't often see at buffets - like donuts, cinnamon rolls and bread pudding. If you have a sweet tooth, this buffet is for you. Insider tips: Some things on the Strip aren't within walking distance - but you can get to those via the Las Vegas Monorail. There's a station that straddles Harrah's and The LINQ Hotel & Casino behind the properties. Don't be afraid to use the self-parking garage. Compared to other Vegas hotels, this one is easy to navigate and convenient. You can access it from the Strip in front of Harrah's or from Linq Lane behind the resort. Once you've parked and taken an elevator to the ground floor, the resort's porte cochere and front desk are merely steps away. Good to know: Harrah's is the perfect place for you to find affordable rooms that put you right on the Strip. If you'd really like something to see from your window and you're a fan of giant observation wheels, then upgrade to a room with a view of the High Roller. There is valet and self-parking. Rates vary, so click here for details.

Slept in rooms that are smokey for 5 nights. Also I couldn't get housekeeping to come and clean the room until the last night D 10.0 Wonderful Denise, Mar. 2023 Stayed there to see Donny Osmond. Was my birthday. Had the best time. Harrahs tried to upsell. But, they did adjust where needed. Las Vegas has become an expensive destination all around but Harrahs was comparable to the others P 10.0 Wonderful Pete, Jun. 2021 Pros:Location and comfort A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, May 2021 Pros:Staff makes me feel like I’m the most important person in the hotel ❤️ Cons:More amenities like ur hotel in Valley Center, California. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jan. 2021 Pros:The service. They upgraded our room for $100 a night to a suite. Cons:Places to sit and chill out. E 10.0 Wonderful eartha, Nov. 2020 Pros:I enjoyed the location and my bed. Cons:Better view of the strip and shower and a tub. B 2.0 Poor Blair, Jul. 2020 Pros:Not one thing. Cons:The service. The friendliness. The common sense of how to treat and talk to another human being opposed to acting like you are better than them. I woke up with bug bites all over my body!! Not to mention COVID-19 is happening rn. Idk what time do but i am so mad at myself for going and taking this 1 day business trip. Never again. H 7.4 Good Hakeem, Jul. 2020 Cons:The staff has tons of false information and can be very rude on the phone. They advertise for a free shuttle from the airport at booking while one phone representative says thet havent had a shuttle in years and proceeded to hang up on me. Another representative says go to the 3rd party company and pay, but when i go they are closed. I spend an hour on the phone of people telling me they do, and they don’t have free shuttle service and no one can actually get in touch with the shuttle or get on the same page. Upon check in the try to convince everyone to use a kiosk that requires touching which is a horrible idea during this pandemic. Only one team member was on hand to check people in which is unacceptable. C 10.0 Wonderful Carin, Jul. 2019 Pros:The view was amazing Cons:My toilet was leaking and needed repair A 5.1 Fair Anonymous, Jun. 2019 Pros:I got my room at cheap rate. Cons:Having access to the refrigerator to keep drinks cold and not having the door sealed shut.
