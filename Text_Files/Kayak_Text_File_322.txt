The breakfast nook was lovely. The rooms were clean and spacious. I loved the small feel of Base Camp Lodge. Breakfast is included (pastries, bagels, fruit, yogurt, milk, coffee, juice). Towels replaced upon request only. Keurig in the room. I think with a bit more time they will work out the kinks! The TV in the room was big and high-def! Just note this is right next to the train, but it didn’t bother us (they have earplugs provided) Cons:1) the hot tub was not ready for use yet (I was really looking forward to that) 2) the parking is very tight, if you get back late...good luck!
