Great value for what was paid. L 2.0 Poor Lisa, Apr. 2023 GROSS!!! We were here with several couples so we able see many rooms to know that ours was not just a fluke. The rooms were run down, not well maintained, not clean. Broken table, tp holder, faucet. hair in shower. Will never stay here again!! For staff, had a very poor experience with the first person we spoke to at check in, but the second person was much better. V 4.0 Mediocre Veronica, Apr. 2023 Free parking was removed in the middle of our trip with no grace period. So we had to pay additional fees for that. Cold water went out in our floor and front desk clerk Fernando was rude and condescending when we inquired about when it might be resolved or if we would need to change rooms. His response? “ I don’t know anything about that and I can’t change your room for that”. The entire conversation with Fernando was frustrating. Due to his attitude, we requested a manager. He leaves and returns without a manager stating “ she’s on a call”. We waited 1/2 hour for manager and no one came. All the occurred from 10-11 at night. Never going back. The attitude and facilities were not worth the cost. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Mar. 2023 The room looked like it was out of the 80's. The tub had mold along the walls, the TV was probably a decade old, it had an old window AC unit and a lamp hanging by a chain over the table. The very worst part was there was construction going on in what I assume was the room above me and it was so loud I couldn't even talk on the phone. It was an absolute nightmare. Luckily for me I wasn't sleeping there only got the room to relax before a red-eye flight. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. J 6.0 Okay Jason, Mar. 2022 The room was ok. There was mold in the shower along the corners. The bed sunk in which was disappointing. The view was terrible. The remote had to be aimed just so to work. The virtual assistant was unresponsive for the most part. I kept getting hounded by people wanting me to purchase a time share every time I walked by. It’s in a bad neighborhood. And the drinks were twice as much as you would expect to pay for a hotel if it’s age and condition. K 4.0 Mediocre Katie, Feb. 2022 We had to wait over 2 hours to check in. We arrived around 1am and didn’t get a room until 3:30am. They used to have self check in kiosks and I have no idea why they got rid of them P 4.0 Mediocre Piti, Nov. 2021 The hotel was absolutely filthy. I could smell cigarette smoke in my room through the vents, the tub was dirty, the floor was filthy. It was definitely not with the money spent. However, the staff was so helpful at check in and assisted us with the process. If not for them, this place would’ve been a nightmare. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Nov. 2021 Walls are thin, could hear neighbors talkings and having sex very clearly. Restroom and room smelled like mildew. Pillows too thick. Cafe food was nasty. A 3.9 Poor Anonymous, Aug. 2021 When I asked to have my bathroom curtain replaced cuz I had another persons blood on it, they didn’t do it. Rooms are a bit dated and standing in like for 45 minutes to get my reserved room didn’t help. Called the front desk for towels and had to call multiple times before I actually got anyone. Would just sit on hold. J 2.0 Poor Joan, May 2021 Pros:The food was good Cons:Cleanliness of the rooms and the hotel as a whole.
