Deep in the Old City a block away from the Frontenac and the funicular down to Petit Champlain, this alone makes this Auberge a tremendous value. Cons:We booked a double, expecting a two bed room. What we got when we arrived was a double bed and a roll away (which felt like a medieval torture device). We lodged our concern with the front desk who indicated that they have no true double rooms and by the way, we owe them $20/night for the additional bed. The conversation that followed was tense, though eventually we landed on a compromise, where the proprietor agreed to revise the hotel listing and we paid a reduced fee. The lesson as always is read the fine print.
