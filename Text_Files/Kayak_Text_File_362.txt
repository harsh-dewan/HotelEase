Practical location. Cons:Rooms were not terribly clean - random bits from previous guests under the bed and you could tell that the carpet needed a good vacuum. you learn this when your young kids decide to start exploring. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Pros:Room was good. Nothing fancy, but clean and comfortable.. Cons:A little put off with all the drunks coming in while I was at the check in with my young boys... A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:Staff were nice. Location is great if your wanting the hip part of town. Great nightlife nearby, taxi fair is cheap to get to restaurants and bars. Getting a hotel near west edmonton mall shouldnt be the priority for hotel picking. Cons:Photos are decieving. Entrance looks good. As soon as the elevator opens it doesnt look good. For the amount its fullpriced at thats in comparison to a nice hotel like Sheraton, its not in the same league. There was questionable guests, maybe they are rating it high. Tape didnt work right. A water bottle would have been nice next to coffee stuff. Balcony is a waste of space and makes the exterior look bad. View is terrible. With such a bad view therr shouldnt be balconies. A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Dec. 2016 Pros:Comfortable rooms and bed. Friendly staff. Cons:Chose this hotel for airport shuttle. After check-in, discovered Shuttle was not complementary, and used outside provider A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, May 2016 Pros:The bed was comfy, but I prefer softer pillows A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Sep. 2014 Pros:Clean, modern, newly renovated rooms.
