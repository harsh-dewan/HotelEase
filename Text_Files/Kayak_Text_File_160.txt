Nice clean rooms! Cons:Not a fan of paid parking. It’s $15 a day A 5.1 Fair Anonymous, Nov. 2016 Pros:Location was great Cons:Smelled like a sewer back-up in the hallways & the ax didn't work so was really hot. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, May 2016 Cons:clean A 6.0 Okay Anthony, Dec. 2015 Pros:Good downtown location Cons:elevator out of order. Wasn't easy to get to and from my room. A 3.7 Poor Anonymous, Dec. 2015 Pros:Staff was friendly. On site parking for minimal charge. Cons:The shower was hot and cold hot and cold. No facilities around and the elevator was broken but said scheduled maintenance. Room was cold. Wall paper is peeling. My Towels were all wet on arrival. Noisy hallways. Check out could not be extended without extraordinary charges. A 4.5 Mediocre Anonymous, Nov. 2015 Pros:Downtown, would be perfect if you didn't have a vehicle and are not going to be there long Cons:Have to pay 15 per night per vehicle, Bad lighting, stairs are set up really weird (doesn't connect you to all parts of hotel) so you have to use elevator or end up going way around the building, A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Mar. 2015 Pros:When we arrived the staff was helpful, the beds were comfy, housekeeping was amazing. The location wasnt perfect but there were busses to the West Edmonton Mall always and a handfull of close restaurants. Cons:We had our wifi cutting out on us or not working every day, our power got shut off 3 times, and the room was fairly small with minimal outlets in the room, all of which were all being used for two extra lamps, a coffee machine we did not use the whole trip, tv, alarm clock that we did not use and a bedside lamp. The elevator was very worrisome, could only hold five people and would sometimes open to the same floor twice, very slow as well. B 9.4 Wonderful Bogdan, Mar. 2015 Pros:Very good for rest A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Sep. 2014 Pros:The cleaning lady was always on time and fast. Cons:Vary out dated. I could hear everyone from other rooms. The key cards kept resetting so I needed to reinstate them several times.
