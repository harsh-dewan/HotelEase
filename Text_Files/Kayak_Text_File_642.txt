E 4.0 Mediocre Emily, May 2017 Pros:bed was comfortable Cons:The front desk staff was rude and very condisending, the staff at the morning buffet was also clearly not in a good mood and was very short with us when asked any questions over all I wouldn't return to this hotel due to my interactions with staff, which is a shame because it does have a good location A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, May 2017 Pros:I loved the bed. It was super comfortable. Excellent hotel. Great price for what you get. Clean. Hardy breakfast.Good snack bag for later. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2017 Pros:This was a roomy one bedroom apartment with accommodations for additional people to sleep in the living room (on the pullout sofa bed). Cons:The kitchen and sofa were a bit dated but convenient. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Apr. 2016 Pros:Very nice place for breakfast along with excellent food. Rooms are very spacious; I had kitchen, two dining tables, a separate living room with two nice sofa beds and another separate room for the queen bed along with two 46 inch TV's. Awesome staff people. Cons:Remote control for the TV's are a bit complicated but I got them to work. There's a busy bar right across the street which can be noisy during weekends. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:Free breakfast and internet. Really huge room. Well located. Good price. Access to a full kitchen. Cons:Mattress too soft. Couch not so comfy (and stinked a little). Breakfast sandwich not really good (but there's a lot more than that to eat for breakfast). M 10.0 Wonderful mark, Aug. 2015 Pros:We expected a hotel room, but we got a small apartment with a full kitchen, dining room, and living room. The amenities have been updated and were quite adequate. It is an older building and the hallways and elevators are dated, but don't let that fool you, the room was very nice. I especially liked that they had very large screen TVs in the living room and bedroom on regular Rogers Cable, not the crappy Hotel system that won't let you watch regular TV in HD. Breakfast was excellent with a large variety of options and EXCELLENT coffee. They didn't mention it, but there is a second room for breakfast across the hall on the other side of the elevators if the main dining room is crowded. Easy walking distance to Parliament Hill, Rideau Canal, and the ByWard Market Cons:The elevators are small, slow and cramped. Six people max per car. Having to pay extra for parking, but it seems to be the norm in Ottawa.
