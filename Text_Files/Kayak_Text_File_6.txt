Parade went right past our hotel. Quebec knows how to throw a parade!! Cons:They did minimum housekeeping. The first night they changed our towels but didn’t make up bed or replace coffee. Because of the snow it would have been nice if they had done a quick mop of the bathroom where mud was tracked in. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, May 2019 Pros:It was very conveniently located with friendly staff, and large rooms. Cons:The curtains in my room did not cover the windows fully, this was particularly noticeable in the bathroom where there was at least a 3 cm gap on either side of the curtain. This issue was compounded by the fact that the toilet was right next to the very large window and my room was on the second floor, it did not lead to a feeling of privacy.
