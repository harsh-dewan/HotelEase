Room was clean- however cramped. There was no mini bar and the hallways were loud at night. Spend your money on a better facility - you’ll pay the same amount but receive better service and a more comfortable stay. A 4.8 Mediocre Anonymous, Jan. 2019 Pros:The room appeared clean. Cons:DoubleTree gave us a room with a queen bed when we paid for a room with a king bed. The room was quite small. Only one elevator seemed to be working with caused people to line up to get on from the lobby. A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Aug. 2018 Pros:The staff was very friendly Cons:Found hairs in our bed and some bugs place looks a little worn A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Jul. 2018 Pros:The room was clean, corner room with lots of light. Easy check in and out. Cons:Extremely loud old fashioned air conditioner, going off and on. No ice machine on Hilton honors floor. Remote did not work, and had no wash clothes in room. Not a luxury hotel. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Cons:Worst hotel MANAGEMENT EVER! Was stuck in DoubleTree Hilton's downtown Toronto elevator for over an HOUR and management did NOTHING!! Only reason I got out was because I called the fire department and THEY got me out. DoubleTree sent an old man with a flashlight over an hour later. If I didn't take it upon myself to call, who knows how many more hours I would have spent there. Then they had the audacity to NOT REFUND either of my 2 nights because it was booked w/ a 3rd party provider. I didn't get stuck in the 3rd party provider's elevator, I got stuck in YOUR ELEVATOR. Avoid at all costs as management will not take care of you. Any other hotel would have refunded and given multiple free nights. N 6.5 Okay Nate, Nov. 2017 Pros:The location is great. Cons:I had a problem with my reservation and was checked out a day earlier than expected on a group business trip. I was offered no help with my luggage. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2017 Pros:It was walking distance to where I needed to be! Fantastic room, bed, clean, great desk for work. Loved it! Will be back! Close to eating places. Didn't get to use the pool or fitness centre but great they have them and close to St Patrick station. Staff were great. Love the warm cookie on arrival! Great deal Cons:Nothing L 9.7 Wonderful lou, Oct. 2017 Pros:The staff went beyond to meet my needs. Always cordial and friendly. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Pros:Friendly staff, great location Cons:We didn't get the size of bed that we had prebooked, the hotel was sold out after I had already prepaid. A 8.5 Very good Andrew, Aug. 2017 Pros:When we arrived (early) the staff were happy to stow our luggage for us, the staff remembered us, ensured that our luggage was safe and organised for a car to take us to the airport the following evening. Location was great. Cons:Nobody told us about the hotel facilities, our son would have loved some pool time before our flight home.
