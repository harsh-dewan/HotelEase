A 10.0 Wonderful Araxie, Apr. 2018 Pros:My boyfriend and I came for our 6 year anniversary. We wanted to explore Toronto, so we came early. The staff was amazing! When we got there, they let us have an early check in and explained the parking and amenities very well. The hotel is in the perfect proximity to everything in Toronto. We will be staying there again upon our return. A 9.4 Wonderful Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:Everything was great Cons:Nothing comes to mind... R 10.0 Wonderful Rami, Aug. 2017 Pros:This was a great deal! It is conveniently located downtown near the Air Canada Centre and a quick walk to the Hockey Hall of Fame. It's not easy finding a 4-star deal downtown, but this was definitely one! Everyone was kind and answered all our questions. Staff throughout the hotel was inquisitive and helpful. Parking on site and not too bad of a price. Highly recommended! Cons:Perfect stay. No complaints. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:Nice room layout and amenities Very quiet Cons:Room heater thermostat did not work well Elevator down button light did not work S 8.0 Very good Sabera, Jan. 2017 Pros:When we booked the hotel there was indoor pool and restaurant . But they have only hottub which is great by the way. After booking , we get an email that restaurant will be closed. That wasnt fair really. Otherwise this is our second stay at cambridge Stafff really nice . Water drain in the living room never got fixed despite complaining. rooms are spacious. A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2016 Pros:I compared alot of hotels for our long weekend visit to Toronto. The Cambridge seemed to offer the best value as far as price, location, and you get a suite not just a room. The room were clean, and recently refurbished. The staff was friendly and helpful. The bed was very firm, but we prefer it that way. The hotel has a strictly enforced no noise policy, which is something we appreciated. We were able to get the rest we needed after very full days taking in Toronto. Cons:The temperature in the room was a little on the warm side. Not uncomfortable, but we would have preferred it a little cooler. Weather outside was in the 90's. Turning the thermostat down did not seem to help. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2015 Pros:Everything was great Cons:Everything R 10.0 Wonderful Rosemary, Jan. 2015 Pros:We stayed at the Cambridge Suites as part of a weekend getaway. In the heart of downtown and right around the corner from Massey Hall, the Cambridge Suites was withiin walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go. The suite was spacious and offered every convenience. The bed was extremely comfortable and the linens clean and crisp. The room was very quiet and the staff was most accomodating. We would definitely stay here again.
