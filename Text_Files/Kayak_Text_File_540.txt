A 3.4 Poor Anonymous, Jul. 2017 Pros:Bed was comfy Cons:We had a horrible stay in a seriously run down hotel. Maid left our door open!!! But we blame hotel owner for not maintaining hotel doors properly so they close automatically like normal hotels have. Way over priced ($150/night) only because the Stampede is on. Hotel is filthy with maid washing carpets in hallway with a mop! Sheets had a stain on them and entire facility is in need of major cleaning and upgrades. Walk to pool area is horrendous and dangerous. Bathrooms are disgusting with hair everywhere and fixtures broken. Breakfast coffee carafes so filthy they look full with stains but were empty. Three travel booking sites had it listed with 3 stars which is totally inaccurate, 2 starts is even too much. Owner lied about having to talk with Brother to approve any type of compensation to credit us. If he isn’t authorized to handle issues than he should be left in charge of the place. Then he insulted us by offering only $20 off what we already drastically overpaid for. All travel booking sites should ensure they have accurate rates for this place. Travelodge and Windham should be ashamed of being associated with this outfit as well. S 7.7 Good shannondebruin, Aug. 2015 Pros:Compared to other hotels in the area, this one was more reasonable in price. The second floor hallway reeks of old cigarettes however the smell does not extend to the rooms. The room was clean, fairly well appointed, lots of room, however the air conditioning unit was not functioning properly. We tried to get it working (it was really hot outside) and pulled the filter to have a look and the filter was disgusting. I would guess it had been many many months since it had last been looked at. It, if ever. I would use it again, however I would try to get a first floor room as the lower hallway did not smell like an old ashtray. Cons:Second floor hallway stinks of old cigarettes. Air conditioner did not work. Staff was all great except one member whose english was so poor that it caused problems at check in. Very lengthy and frustrating experience.
