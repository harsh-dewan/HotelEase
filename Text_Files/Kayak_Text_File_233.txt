Cons:The bathroom door did not stay closed. The TV didn't seem to work at all. The room's walls seemed very thin, I could hear the neighbours flushing and taking a shower. K 7.7 Good Ken, Oct. 2014 Pros:Great indoor swimming pool; location was good, staff friendly. We booked a king size bedroom and were pleasantly surprised when we entered the room to find a full kitchen, dining area, sitting area and of course the king size bedroom. Cons:The air conditioner was a portable unit and was noisy. Window opened so we had fresh air and no need to run the air conditioner. The heating units were on the roof just outside our room and were very loud when they kicked in during the night. Breakfast was good, but expensive.
