Beaches Worthy of the Mediterranean In the English Channel, just off the Normandy coast, Jersey has wonderful beaches that wouldn‚Äôt look out of place in the Mediterranean. The largest Channel Island, it is a UK dependency, but has a distinctly Gallic feel and a dialect closer to French than English. Home to the largest concentration of Jersey hotels, St Helier - the capital - is centred on a harbour protected by 16th-century Elizabeth Castle, an offshore fort beautifully lit at night. Gorey also has fantastic Mont Orgueil castle, which dominates the multi-coloured fa√ßades and fishing boats below. Trinity in the north has one of the Jersey hotels on the beach and a wildlife park. Speaking of animals, in fields nearby and all over the island are fine examples of the brown Jersey cow that originated here. Gr√®ve de Lecq has a beautiful curved beach, while the longest beach runs along the west coast from the St Ouen to St Brelade regions. In between is St Peter, site of Jersey Airport, while the war tunnels in neighbouring St Lawrence are now a museum and one of the most popular Jersey attractions. Whichever choice you make from the range of apartments, guest houses and hotels in Jersey on Booking.com, it‚Äôs comforting to know that you are staying on a Fairtrade Island.
