Charge for parking at the hotel is cheaper than most in the area. Cons:I don't like that the pool closes at 8pm, very few amenities -not even free breakfast anymore, no refrigerators or microwaves, have to pay for parking. A 2.8 Poor Anonymous, Aug. 2016 Pros:Nothing Cons:Everything starting from parking to the room I have never been in a hotel that I have to pay for parking... Very bad experience....... A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Jul. 2016 Pros:Location. The pool. Cons:A little outdated A 7.7 Good Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:Staff were attentive. Cons:the room is bit old A 4.5 Mediocre Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:the lady at the desk named Tayna was excellent. Cons:the hotel booked 5 rooms to a group of young boys beside us. They were told that they were not to make a lot of noise, which was far from what they did. 5 calls were made to the front desk from us to have them come down and make these several boys to be quite, the 4th call was made after 2:00am the last call was made after 4:20 am. When we left the room there was garbage in the hall and out side the exit door. We were at the desk after 6:00am and asked for the deposit. The 2 night men on call said that they would not give us the $223.00 because not all of were checking out until 9:00am. I had put the deposit on my debit card and explained I had to leave and the other 5 remaining were over 50 - 77 years old, what were we going to break? They also lied when we were complaining about the number of times calls were made to have the boys be quite or what they should have done was kick them out. Tanya found the calls and told us the 2 night guys lied, also said our deposit should have been given back. We had 2 rooms as you know and one of the rooms was for 2 seventy seven year olds. Out of the 6 of us, none were able to sleep. The 2- 77 year old ladies room was right across the hall from were the boys were hanging out and coming in and out from outside. Horrible experience!!! Room cleanliness was ok. The view was awful, we looked out to an abandoned building or parking lot, not sure what it was. a letter was wrote before we left and a call has been made to "get a room" to get our money back by a suggestion from the morning staff. The night staff were extremely rude! A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:close walk to the falls Cons:extra charge for parking per day.. dirty carpets.. "heated" pool seems a bit of a over statement.. my package included a "$50 Food and Beverage Credit" what we got was 2 20$ off coupons, 1 for applebee's and 1 for some steakhouse, you had to spend 40$ to use them. A 4.0 Mediocre Anonymous, Aug. 2015 Cons:I found the rooms to be lacking in up to date amenities and seemed to filled with stale air. Maintenance staff should take a course in how properly repair items. I will not be retuning and I will be recommending that people I know should spend their hard earned money elsewhere. A 2.0 Poor Anonymous, Aug. 2015 Cons:room smelled really bad and was no way to air it out, was not a good value for our dollar. kayak also does not advertise that their bookings are in US funds. Buyer beware A 3.7 Poor Anonymous, Aug. 2015 Pros:Good location. Staff were accommodating when we were not happy with the first room. Cons:Long line to check in and whenever we went to the front desk. We waited about 25-30 minutes just to check in. Best word to describe the 1st room we were given is "dungeon". 2nd room was nicer. B 4.0 Mediocre belljim4, Jun. 2015 Pros:Location was good Cons:Our room was dingy and dated Location 6519 Stanley Avenue, Niagara Falls, ON L2G 7L2 What's nearby Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort361 m Journey Behind The Falls0.5 km Skylon Tower0.6 km Niagara Falls Tower0.8 km Queen Victoria Park0.8 km Niagara Falls0.9 km Niagara Falls History Museum1.1 km Niagara SkyWheel1.4 km Great Canadian Midway1.4 km Ripley's Believe it or Not1.4 km Louis Tussaud's Waxworks1.5 km Three Sisters Islands1.5 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
