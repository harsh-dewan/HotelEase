The walls are thin and you can hear people in the hallway and other rooms talking. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2023 The rooms are all VERY close together. The end of one hallway has 4 doors side by side which includes the corner rooms that are somehow “bigger” I was told but it was average at best. Older hotel with modern decor and updated-ish bathrooms. Fresh coat of paint with minimal prep work, so it shows a poor job done. AC unit just blew air, was hardly cold. Parking is $45/night which is atrocious but I guess fairly standard across Seattle, so hard to be mad at just this hotel. Beds were very comfy and pillows were nice. Plug-ins only on one side of the bed which is bad for couples. Gal at the front desk was very nice. M 5.1 Fair Michael, May 2019 Pros:The staff were very friendly. Cons:The room was basically a closet, the fact that it cost almost $250 and another $38 for parking is absolutely absurd. It's also terribly outdated. I would've stayed somewhere else had I known how disappointing and overpriced the room was. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Dec. 2017 Pros:Bathrooms are tiny. The tub is high which made it difficult for our more senior friends to get into the shower. It was really clean and would be great for business and did offer a good value for a downtown hotel. A 5.7 Fair Anonymous, Oct. 2017 Pros:Location. Cons:Not even a chair for sitting. Too small a room. Bath faucet needed fixing. E 9.1 Wonderful Ellen, Sep. 2017 Pros:The staff at the Executive Hotel Pacific were fantastic. They were helpful with recommendations and with ensuring my husband and I got to the airport on time for our (very early) flight. The room itself was just fine. We are used to smaller hotel rooms like this one, so it wasn't an issue for us at all. The bed was comfy, the room was clean—we had everything we needed. The location can't be beat: it's an easy walk to the Pike Place Market, among many other things. Cons:Because the hotel is old, the rooms aren't as sound proof as I would have liked. We could hear a lot of banging and shuffling in the room next to ours. Thankfully it didn't impact us getting good sleep, but it was something I noticed. A 4.8 Mediocre Anonymous, Apr. 2017 Cons:Paper thin walls A 5.7 Fair Anonymous, Mar. 2017 Pros:Umbrellas in the lobby. Friendly staff! Cons:Tiny rooms, entire facility could use a face lift. Elevators don't stop at floor level so you're either lugging your suitcase up or down a level to get onto the elevator. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Nov. 2016 Pros:Location to Century Link Field was good. Good location to other amenities. The bar downstairs was really good. Cons:Rooms were small and dated. A 5.1 Fair Anonymous, Nov. 2016 Pros:Location make it convenient to get around downtown. Cons:Room was very warm with no way to turn down the heat or cool it off and guests in the room next door talking all night made it hard to sleep.
