Killarney is a beautiful town, and it's best to visit outside of tourist season. We enjoyed the parks and the shopping area, and the whole town is easy to walk about. We rented a car to drive around the Ring of Kerry, and I would have taken more than one day to drive it, or would have taken a bus just to hit the highlights. Elizabeth United States 10 Killarney and the surrounding areas are picturesque. Killarney and the surrounding areas are picturesque. We have been travelling to Killarney for many years and can honestly say that County Kerry is one of the most beautiful areas in Ireland. There are many places to visit as well as many restaurants for all ages. Angela United Kingdom 10 The town itself is quite touristy which was positive in that... The town itself is quite touristy which was positive in that it was still lively in late October, but perhaps doesn't offer an authentic Irish experience! However, it‚Äôs great fun, with lots of shops and pubs and bars to visit. The best bit of Killarney though is the wonderful National Park which is right next to the town centre. It is home to red and Japanese Sika deer, it has lakes and castles and walking trails for all abilities. Definitely worth a look! The town is also a great base for exploring the Ring of Kerry, and the Beara and the Dingle Peninsulas. Suzy United Kingdom 10 Plenty to do and see. Plenty to do and see. From Hill walking/hiking, horse riding, kayaking, boat trips, golf, of course, deer rutting, national park, sight seeing, fantastic restaurants, quaint to fancy pubs, shopping or just lazing around and sipping coffee/tea and people watching etc, You name it they have it! NOT TO MENTION THE "JARVIS" and their stories. anne Ireland 10 Killarney is such a special place. Killarney is such a special place. The views are amazing and it's a short walk to the National Park. Situated in a beautiful location, the town has many restaurants, bars and traditional Irish pubs. We had lunch in J.M Reidy, a charming traditional pub, with historical items all over the walls. At the back there is a labyrinth of other bars and eating spaces. There are plenty of high street shops including Pennies (Primark), Poundland, Pharmacy etc. quite a few souvenir shops too which are perfect to pick up gifts for the family. The people are so welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend for a short getaway. Easy to navigate the streets and there are affordable taxi companies if you need to go a little further out. Victoria United Kingdom 10 I spent 3 nights in Killarney. I spent 3 nights in Killarney. Had some free time the day I arrived so visited the grounds at Muckross House which are stunning. The next 2 days were tours, Gap of Dunloe and the Ring of Kerry, both with Dero's and both brilliant. Gorgeous Celtic Jewellery at McCormacks on Main Street, Lucy was so helpful and the prices very reasonable. There is so much more I would have liked to have seen but sadly had to move on.
