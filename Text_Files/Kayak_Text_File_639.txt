Rooms are old. Elevator need update. Very dark. Overpriced. Room was 800$ which is insane. Hotel is just bad value and really dingy. A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Apr. 2019 Cons:The computer system went down , was stuck out in the cold , keycards did not work R 5.7 Fair Ryan, Aug. 2018 Pros:Area is great, staff very good Cons:Room smelled of a smoker, horrible view on lower floor A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Jul. 2018 Pros:The area you’re in was great and the price we got on kayak made it worth it. Don’t know what the regular price would be but do not think I’d pay more than what I did. Cons:Ice buckets only on every other floor, wanted to go to the bistro on the main floor but it seemed like it was a 5 star place. The fact that there is only one way into the hotel, would be nice to have a door on Yonge street. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2018 Pros:Loved the hotel and the location just steps from the subway and walking distance from the eatons center. Staff was all very helpful and friendly. Got an upgrade to a king bed room. Cons:I was on the 2nd floor so I could hear the traffic and people late at night, but it didn't bother me too much. M 10.0 Wonderful Mohammed, Dec. 2017 Pros:Friendly staff Easy accessable to every thing in downtown Cons:Non A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Sep. 2017 Pros:Extremely pleasant and helpful staff, very clean Cons:Elevators need upgrade A 4.5 Mediocre Anonymous, May 2017 Pros:Nothing just location A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:As always i think the location is great. Your in the middle of most attractions, theater, shopping. Cons:We were really looking forward to seeing the newly renovated hotel. However ended up very disappointed. A quick glance and it looks great. When you get up close you can clearly see it was a rushed job and not professionally done which added to all the faults. T 8.2 Very good Tony, Dec. 2016 Pros:The number one selling point for this hotel, is that it is located right in downtown Toronto on Yonge street and is one block away from the line 1 College subway station, which is also a stop on the 506 Carlton streetcar line. There are also an unlimited number of reasonably priced places to eat and shop within walking distance of the hotel. The staff were very pleasant and helpful Cons:My room was directly across the hall from a bank of four elevators. Fortunately, the hotel was not very busy or it would have been disturbing. The walls are thin and not well sound insulated. I could too much from the adjacent room. There is a new building construction across the street, so you won't get to "sleep in" on the average weekday. Of course this is a temporary situation beyond Marriott's control, which will auto-rectify once the building is completed Location 475 Yonge Street, Toronto, ON M4Y 1X7 What's nearby Toronto Eaton Centre0.9 km University of Toronto1.1 km Nathan Phillips Square1.1 km Royal Ontario Museum1.2 km Art Gallery Of Ontario1.2 km Kensington Market1.6 km Hockey Hall of Fame1.7 km St. Lawrence Market1.8 km Princess of Wales Theatre1.8 km TIFF Bell Lightbox1.8 km Scotiabank Arena2.1 km CN Tower2.2 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 4:00 PM, check out anytime before 11:00 AM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
