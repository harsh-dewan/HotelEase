Minor inconveniences that didn’t keep me from booking another night for our next time to Montreal later this summer. G 10.0 Wonderful Gisele, Dec. 2018 Pros:I liked everything but the only thing I think is the valet parking is overbudget $28 per day. Cons:The parking garage, you have to pay $28 per day A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2017 Pros:Right on St Catherin st, all kinds of places to visit walking distance. Extremely pleasant staff. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2017 Pros:The hotel is very clean, friendly and professional. It was a great location with transit and old Montreal in walking distance. Cons:It would have been cool to have mtl city passes and things available for purchase at the hotel but it's more so a nice to have.
