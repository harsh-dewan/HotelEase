However, it was great for the value, clean, great location and friendly staff. Beds were very comfy but may be too soft for some. I will definitely stay again!

These are not too close. 3 blocks to over a kilometer! The staff was not terribly helpful. They don’t take a few USA credit cards. They lost my paperwork over the course of 12 hours. A lot of what they do is not electronic.
