Don't trust the pictures you see online. Cleanliness standards were very low also staff is very rude. A 9.4 Wonderful Anonymous, May 2019 Pros:There was no breakfast A 4.2 Mediocre Anonymous, Jun. 2018 Pros:Was in jasper Cons:Not very clean, seen wrappers and things under The bed. Room and bathrooms were old and the renovation that were done were not done well. Looks like the tile in the bathroom was done someone who should not be doing tile. A lot of money for an old motel. A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Sep. 2017 Pros:Tonquin inn is okay. The beds are comfy and the room is a good size but a facelift is needed to freshen up everything. Pricing is probably a little expensive with no breakfast inclusions. Staff at reception were quite young and not very engaging. Cons:Dated furniture and a little old. A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Pros:Nice staff and rooms very cleen. Good bed. Cons:The pillows too fat. The air con was loud. Walls very thin. The price was too high for the hotel, but no higher than other hotels. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Oct. 2016 Pros:Comfortable, clean room, conveniently located, good value. Cons:Breakfast selection on the cold buffet was limited, eg no healthy cereals. Waitress did not understand English. A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, Aug. 2015 Pros:Kids loved the pool facilities. We had 2 adults and 2 young children in one room. Rooms were small and cramped, but fine for sleeping. Well overdue for an update/renovation and not ANOTHER coat of paint over the old! A 8.2 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2015 Pros:We were given an upgrade which was a nice surprise and the room was beautifully done. It was clean and the hotel had a great location with its proximity to town. Cons:There was very limited parking and that was unsettling. The hotel seemed to be cramped for space, but it was very nice. A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2015 Pros:The pool was larger than at many places in this price range. The hours were OK but an earlier opening than 9am would have been good esp. on my last day. The bathroom was huge and would have accommodated a wheel chair. A recycle bin was a welcome sign. Cons:The tile floor around the pool and in the dressing room was very slippery. Believe the 4pm check-in. They do not have enough cleaners or they do not work enough hours. Also I asked for no service for my 3 night stay but when the "do not disturb" sign was taken from my door, the room was serviced. The AC had made the room quite cold at check-in. I turned it off and then only turned it on briefly one evening. M 6.3 Okay min, Jul. 2014 Pros:The room has AC. This is important in summer since it can get pretty hot in Jasper. The bed is comfy and clean. Cons:The location is kind of far from the town center. It is pricey for an inn level room.
