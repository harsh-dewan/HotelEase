Cons:Technology was not good (key cards, etc.) Staff not great. Dirty floors, which will get on your sheets. A 4.2 Mediocre Anonymous, Nov. 2014 Pros:Location was good, and view was nice from hotel during the Rememberence Day parade. Cons:Building itself needs a lot of maintenance. Our room was nice, but the sheets had stains on them, and the bed and pillows were not comfortable. There were holes in the walls in the closets, and just not a comfortable place to stay. Wifi was a $14 extra charge per day, and parking was an extra $20. Parking is in an underground garage, and is falling apart, and "sketchy", to say the least. Bathroom was very small with old shower curtain and scratches in the tub. Not impressed at all with our stay. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Sep. 2014 Pros:Convenient location, as I had business at the University of Toronto. Cons:Not so much a dislike, but rather a warning: My suite was huge. I was embarrassed by how much room I had, especially as I was out for most of the day, including for meals.
