David the front manager made sure we got another room that was more comfortable as a family. Him and his staff went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Becks in reservations was also super accommodating with all our changes to our reservations even helping out after our cancellation period was over. We had some issues with pushing dates and cancelling dates because of COVID restrictions. Hotel is at excellent location from the gondolas, rooms are comfortable and clean. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back. You can find other hotels with same location but the staff made all the difference for us. Thank you so much A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Sep. 2018 Pros:Late check out. Pool/hot tub. Although the sauna was out of order. Cons:Encountered multiple staff while we were there.
