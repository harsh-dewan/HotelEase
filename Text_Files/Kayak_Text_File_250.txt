Cons:You literally get what you pay for, in other words, don't expect much if you're not paying much. Rooms were a little less than amazing but as expected. Free parking. Not far from everything touristy in the falls. S 2.0 Poor sygrove_k, Aug. 2015 Pros:Nothing. Cons:I didn't get the room I had reserved and payed for. They said it was the website's fault, so instead of trying to fix it, they brushed it off as not their problem. I booked a queen room for my husband's birthday, I got 2 double beds, which according to the staff there, was "an upgrade". The window hinge was broken and the window would not close fully. It had no screen and we were on the first floor which looked onto the parking lot where there was a loud get together going on. I told the lady at the desk that the window was broken, and she said she could make it close. I instead, requested another room on the second floor, and was moved there. This room was not much better. The whole building was dated and the carpets are stained and filthy. There was a strong stench of garbage throughout the halls and elevator. The outdoor pool was closed- in the middle of the summer, which had been one of the reasons I booked a room there in the first place. Very disappointed. Would never stay there again if you paid me.
