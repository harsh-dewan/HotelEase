A Volcanic Land of Wonders Rotorua is living proof of the magnificent, and sometimes mind-boggling, might of nature. Smoking hot springs, bubbling mud pools and fast-spouting geysers give the surrounding landscape an almost other-worldly feel. This New Zealand city sits in the Waimangu Volcanic Valley, the world‚Äôs newest geothermal hotspot. It was created after the 1886 eruption that covered Te Wairoa Buried Village, between 2 of many lakes gracing this fertile terrain. By Lake Rotorua‚Äôs shores is the luxurious Polynesian Spa with its thermal pools. Just behind in Government Gardens are the city‚Äôs best cultural offerings: the Arts Village, Tamaki Maori Village and Rotorua Museum, in an elegant former bath house. Native animals roam in Rainbow Springs Kiwi Wildlife Park below Mount Ngongotaha, accessible via the Skyline cable car. The views while ascending make it obvious why this is called the Bay of Plenty. Tikitere Thermal Park on the opposite side of the lake is known as Hell‚Äôs Gate, but as long as you can ignore the sulphuric smell, the spas are simply heavenly. More springs are in Whakarewarewa Thermal Reserve, whose surrounding forest is popular for mountain biking, and Wai-O-Tapu where the Champagne Pool is a striking mix of green and orange. Booking.com‚Äôs accommodation range is as diverse as the scenery, encompassing luxury hotels, cheap hostels and motels near Rotorua Airport.

What guests said about Rotorua: 10 I love the whole energy of the place. I love the whole energy of the place. Everyone is friendly and helpful. It is a tourist town but it doesn't feel cheap and tacky because of how lovely the locals are. I really loved the 3D maze and aMAZEme. Affordable family fun that lasts a while. The Polynesian Spa is also a wonderful indulgence, if you can get away from the kids. The Redwood tree top walk is an absolute must. The smell is something that hits you, but you get used to it. We had a hire camper van that was very large and we were not the best at driving it but the locals were very easy going about the challenge this causes and I was amazed at how congenial my driving experience was. Ooh, also...bunny mini golf! Sorsha 10 If you have not been before it is a must for all travelers. If you have not been before it is a must for all travelers.

As a return traveler, I was keen to see the newly landscaped lake front promenade which wends it's way along to the architecturally designed International Spa, and nearby Queen Elizabeth healing Clinic.
