Maybe that’s the reason why hundreds of people drop down on one knee at the top of the tower each year. The dizzying heights and stunning views alone are enough to give anyone butterflies, but a meal at the magical ‘Le Jules Verne’ restaurant might just seal the deal.

To fully appreciate it, I would suggest taking a tour that includes information about the tower and its history and also lets you skip the line for entry. Is it worth a few extra Euro to go to the very top? I'd say, "Yes!" Best Tip: GET YOUR TICKETS IN ADVANCE. The ticket line for those that aren't already ticket holders can be painfully long.

Show more Show less Brenda South Africa What guests said about Eiffel Tower: I stood beneath the Eiffel Tower and looked up trying to imagine the past and the men that built this magnificent structure if one goes to the Louvre you acquire headsets. It is pretty amazing viewing a painting of Napoleon crowning Josephine and the historical significance of this amazing piece of art is explained in the most beautiful artistic voice. Captivating... , not just this one painting the whole museum of priceless treasures. I felt honoured to view this amazing collection. The artifacts are breathtaking. It is amazing riding a double decker bus and wearing a headset. Two trips around the city and you are most familiar with the sights and their historical significance to start your journey. Plaques in doorways and on statue's leave the visitor a good over view of the past. A trip to Versailles again headsets that advise the visitors the past. The streets, the cobblestones the architecture, the open markets and cafe's, the preservation of the past intact is so very amazing to a first time visitor. Paris is exciting! Paris is busy. Paris is steeped in culture and is bigger than life itself. I stood beneath the Eiffel Tower and looked up trying to imagine the past and the men that built this magnificent structure. The residents of Paris make their city come to life. They are proud of their city. Very clean and orderly.

Use the Metro and the "river taxi" (that's what I call it, anyway). DO enjoy cafe au lait often at outdoor cafes, look at around and up at the old buildings, take your time and soak it all in. Don't waste money on 4 & 5, or even 3 - star hotels & "fancy" restaurants - see where the most French are eating and try those places. But, I'm biased and fluent in the language. One can "do" Paris in 3 days - Musee d'Orsay, Musee Marmottan (Monets!!!), Sacre Coeur, Eiffel Tower & Notre Dame, and if you must, the Arc de Triomphe, but it's not worth the hassle).
