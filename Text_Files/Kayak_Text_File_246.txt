Clean and with a modern feel. Would highly recommend. A 9.4 Wonderful Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:The restaurant was especially good... with all the amazing places to eat in Montreal, I hesitated on choosing to eat at the Hotel. I was very pleasently surprised at the qualiy of the food on the menu. My supper was delicious and I did not regret staying in for the evening. It made my business trip less tiring. The service was also excellent. The bar is really nice, again you do not feel like you are in a hotel... Cons:The early shuttle service in the morming is only every hour... which meant that for my 6:30 flight, I woul$ have had to take the 4:39 shuttle! I stayed at the Novatel airport hotel instead of the downtown one to ge5 more sleep! I ended up taking a taxi and a good think I did because early morning security at Trudeau airport was brutal ! W 10.0 Wonderful Wendy, Oct. 2016 Pros:Friendly & diverse staff. Cons:Can't complain. J 2.0 Poor jeffji, Jul. 2015 Pros:I do not like it at all due to this person. J 8.0 Very good Joseph, Oct. 2014 Pros:I liked the fact that the hotel was close to the airport. I liked the indoor swimming pool and hot tub which was an added plus for our six year old granddaughter. Also, the room was much larger than I expected and the price was very reasonable.
