Lots of good food options A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Sep. 2023 Most important: no resort fees. Do make sure to gamble to get parking validated bc you’re gonna spend it on parking anyways. Also empty your car. The location is great. I could easily double fist two beers and have two more in my back pockets and just cruise up and down Fremont going back to my room to resupply and then back to Circa. Rooms are clean and pretty modern. Good location to also catch ride shares and not be too expensive. This is my go to spot when in Vegas. R 6.0 Okay Roxann, Sep. 2023 Our room air conditioning had problems. After 3 days of engineering working on it 72 degrees was finally achieved. Many homeless people wandering inside casino asking for money from people who were seated and gambling. The door security guards need to address this better. J 6.0 Okay J, May 2023 North side is pretty run down. They put me in a smokers room and it smelled like an Ash tray. Was very old looking. The hotel had a lot of smokers in it. They also charge you a room deposit. I booked through kayak/priceline. They charged a 100 dollar deposit for a ashtray room lol. Also quite loud. Can hear all the music on the street word for word. Even if you're on the 18th floor. On the plus side, the view was nice. No resort fees, free Valet and cheap. Valet people were super nice. L 2.0 Poor Lance, Apr. 2021 Pros:The restaurants were good Cons:The rooms cleaner they smelt bad A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Mar. 2021 Pros:Location Cons:Glad the Freemont Experience ends 2:00 a.m. because we heard it right outside our window every hour until then. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Mar. 2021 Pros:loved the location and no resort fee Cons:beds were a bit uncomfortable but you do get what you pay for. Ceiling was DIRTY with lots of dust. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2020 Pros:Breakfast was great, our TV wasn't working n before we could get to the room the maintenance man was waiting for us n fixed it right away.
