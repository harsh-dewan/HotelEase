Although room was rather spartan, a little table would be good to enable some work done. Cons:Too noisy and disturbing mainly from banging of passage door when guests came back and leave their rooms to places. Suggest replacing doors with spring door that closes softly. Meanwhile even putting weather strips along the length of the door may help with the banging noise on all common amenity doors A 7.4 Good Anonymous, May 2017 Pros:It wasn'thorrible, we had a private room and we're close to the washrooms. The hostel had a bunch of character too which was cool. Now that a hostel is like $10 less than a cheap hotel I'm always hoping I'm paying for character with hostels. Cons:The blankets, toilets and showers were all a bit less on the clean side.
