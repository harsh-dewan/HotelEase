Free parking. Pretty quiet area. Cons:I'd prefer having eggs for breakfast then sweet pancakes A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Feb. 2015 Pros:The hotel was ok for a place to stay while you spent most of your day out on the town. It was affordable and the living conditions were adequate. I wouldn't recommend staying here if you plan to stay in the hotel for a significant amount of your stay.
