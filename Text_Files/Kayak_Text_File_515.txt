If you get a room in the 280s they send you to the back 40 and its hard to tell if you're even on their property anymore, it looks more like an abandoned construction site. The staff were alright. The hot tub is medicore at best. All the pictures must be from 10 years ago because everything looks considerably more run down then any of the photos they show. Its better just to spend the extra $50-$100 and get considerably more bang for your buck A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2016 Pros:The location was easy to access, staff were friendly and helpful. Room was not fancy but comfortable and clean.
