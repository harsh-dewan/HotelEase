Having to return to the room to pick something up before leaving for the day the following morning my partner's key did not work and she picked up my key and it did not work. Neither key had been exposed to credit cards or cellphones. The front desk staffer was seemingly polite but did get snippy when I complained. This excuse is ridiculous as cell phones and credit cards cannot cause a key card to demagnetize. The problem is in the magnetizer, the way it is operated, or the room card readers. It is not the fault of the customer which is implied. I am not happy about this treatment. Also, the breakfast area is way too small to accommodate the number of guests using it. It was a zoo and spilled out into the lobby. There needs to be another more private area to eat and the serving area should be expanded. D 3.7 Poor David, Aug. 2017 Pros:Beds Cons:Worn out old hotel R 8.8 Very good Rita, May 2017 Pros:Although this is an older facility, it is well-kept. breakfast great , staff helpful, location superb C 9.1 Wonderful Christopher, Mar. 2017 Pros:The staff was very accommodating to my situation, I had got into town early and they allowed me to check in early to my hotel room. They were also friendly and when my key card didn't work, they fixed it immediately with no problem. Cons:Not a huge issue, but the motel looked like it was last renovated in the late '90s. I wish that it was more up to date and that the place didn't look so old. A 3.1 Poor Anonymous, Mar. 2017 Pros:Location is close to the space needle is the only thing this hotel has going for itself Cons:The hotel was old and smelled bad. I didn't even want to bring food back to the hotel since the odor was so foul. I tried asking for a refund but since I booked through a 3rd party. The staff named Zac said I couldn't get a refund if I left early. But his supervisor could probably do it he said. But yet he did not ask her to do it. I booked tues-Sunday. But left Thursday Instead with no refund. Just avoid this hotel unless if you are traveling alone and need to save a few bucks. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Mar. 2017 Pros:Small and simple. Had a great hot tub open all year round outside. I had one night left and wanted one with a hot tub, so that's what I went searching for and found the Travellodge at the Space Needle. Nice stay for my last night in Seattle. Also had a great continental breakfast, another thing on my wish list. Cons:The hallways seemed a bit dingey so it made you unsure at first, but overall was a nice stay. Good enough where I needed it to be. A 6.5 Okay Anonymous, Oct. 2016 Pros:We loved the breakfast, l think it was very complete: waffles, eggs, sausage, cereals, breads, fruit, juices, cheese, yogurt, pastries, etc. They also have complementary coffee and tea 24hr at reception, the rooms are clean, they have a keurig with k cups which is great, small fridge. Location is great. Cons:It was a bit outdated, needs renovations, the ceiling noises were horrible, l could hear people walking, not so much for the walls, the windows are also thin, the bathroom has a shower not a tub, wall paper is old and gross, But it was the cheapest and l think it was worth it. A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:Close to a lot of attractions. Price good for Seattle. Breakfast was pretty good. Cons:Bed wasn't great. Not the nicest hotel. Basically a place to sleep. A 9.4 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2016 Pros:The quality of the TV was excellent! Also, the selection of cable channels were excellent! Cons:Extremely disappointed that it was not until I arrived that I found out I would be charged over $16 a night to park my rental car in the lot. I thought I should have been told about this additional charge when I booked the room. A 5.7 Fair Anonymous, Apr. 2016 Pros:It was good location. Employees were chill. Good service overall.
