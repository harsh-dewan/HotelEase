Cheap, reasonably comfortable bed for the price, staff seemed limited in ability but were pleasant, Car2Go vehicles parked nearby. Best used by solo travelers who have flexible expectations or seasoned motel users who just need a bed for a night. Cons:Limited parking, dining options close by are of the McDonald's and Denny's variety, building is old and poorly maintained, cleanliness is suspect at best. Don't think they offer food/beverage, but if they do I wouldn't partake if I were you. Can't stress enough this place is only for those times when you just need a room for a night, not anything more.
