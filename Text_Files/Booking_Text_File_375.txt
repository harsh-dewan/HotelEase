A Greek Island Dream Imagine a typical Greek island with whitewashed houses, blue-domed churches and sloping cliffs, and the chances are that you‚Äôre thinking of Santorini. Protectively curving around 4 other islands in its archipelago, this volcanic island has fertile ground bringing forth lovely ros√© wine and some of the sweetest cherry tomatoes you‚Äôll ever taste. High on a caldera shelving into the sea, the capital Fira overlooks the cruise liners plying the turquoise Aegean waters below. North is Imerovigli, home to several 5-star Santorini hotels with fantastic views. Also providing amazing views is the accommodation in Oia across the bay. Cascading down the slopes, the sea of white here is only dispersed by vibrant pink flowers, blue domes and the brown of ancient windmills, all becoming black silhouettes as the sun sets. Santorini Airport is on the other side of the island and 2 resorts south of it ‚Äì Kamari and Perissa ‚Äì have the best, black sand beaches. However, the most visually impressive is Red Beach at Akrotiri where the stunning red colour of the caldera and sand makes the trek down the rockface well worth it. Just time it right to avoid high tide! Also near Akrotiri are excavations of a Minoan era settlement. Wherever you choose to stay, Booking.com has a fantastic range of B&Bs, apartments and hotels in Santorini (Thira in Greek).

The room had a huge balcony/terrace that as per the name of the Hotel we saw the last sunbeam from the great Santorini Sunset. The room was spacious and clean and was really an excellent stay. The host/manager was very accomodating helping us with anything we needed including transfers to Oia, Akrotiri, The Port and the airport.
