Bed blankets were stained and with hairs. The entire bed and bathroom had hairs. No coffee maker. L 4.0 Mediocre Lizzi, Jul. 2021 Pros:Room was quiet. Cons:There is no in-room coffee, microwave, or fridge. M 8.0 Very good Maegan, Oct. 2020 Pros:The rooms were clean and staff upheld the hotels covid procedures. Pool area was also nice. Cons:We ended up in a room with the window completely blocked by a neon bingo sign. The ac also seemed to be ready for a repair/ tune up. M 7.4 Good Mark, Oct. 2020 Pros:If you are planning to visit Freemont Experience, this is a good hotel to stay at as it is right there. Great prices for rooms. Hash House is also downstairs in the casino along with a small coffee bar that has pretty good coffee. Casino is decent. Parking was free as a guest so that was a plus. The beds were comfortable and the size of the room was good. We didn't have any issues with noise. Cons:The cleanliness of the room was okay. But could have been better. There were dirty socks left from a previous guest that were left on a shelf. It was a high shelf, but still should not have been missed. The TV in the room is a tiny 32". There is no mini fridge in the room which would have been nice. We smelled Marijuana throughout our stay in the room. The pool is small and there were a lot of people swimming. We skipped the pool. The check in was confusing. We parked in the front for check in but were told by security that we had to move our car. I would recommend parking first, then checking in with all of your luggage. V 8.0 Very good Valerie, Feb. 2020 Pros:Room was very clean and undated Cons:They give u no perks to stay there! A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Jan. 2020 Pros:Clean, large newly renovated room. Smelled good on the hallways and in the room. Casino small compared to some but easier to get around and many food options within the hotel. At the end of Fremont street which was very convenient.
