You can't turn left on Marine drive A 5.4 Fair Anonymous, May 2019 Pros:I didn't like this hotel. I would not book it again. No breakfast offered. The shuttle did not come to the front of the hotel like I was told so I had to carry two suitcases up two sets of stairs out the back of the hotel with NO assistance. Very tired and dated looking, no space for suitcases. Reception was not very friendly. They could be a lot more friendly. Cons:Everything - management training, upgrading A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Jan. 2019 Cons:Restaurant could have been cleaner K 7.1 Good Knut, Nov. 2017 Pros:Staff, rooms & restaraunt good. Airport Shuttle makes for obvious choice to stop over. Will be my choice next trip. Cons:Only inconvenience was empty vending machines. Long way from Skytrain station if a person wants the night out down town. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:The price was great, the location to the airport convenient & the airport shuttle was perfect. Cons:The staff, every time I'd called, seemed to want to get off the line as quickly as possible. I'd called to confirm how the shuttle worked & called twice more with our ETA when our arrival kept getting delayed while we came by train to Vancouver. A 7.7 Good Anonymous, Aug. 2016 Pros:Great location to access transit within Vancouver. Quick to get downtown and around A 4.2 Mediocre Anonymous, Jul. 2016 Pros:Rooms were clean and a good size. Cons:The staff at the front desk were not friendly or approachable. We asked them to call us a cab a couple times and each time it seemed like they couldn't be bothered. We asked them for suggestions on how to get to and from places and they just gave us this animated map that we already had. Also, the airport shuttle was a joke. We waited for one to pick us up at the airport and he just drove by us and didn't stop or even slow down (all of the other hotel shuttles stopped for a minute to see if anyone would come). We had to call the hotel who told us they would send him back. Also! When he dropped us back at the airport after our stay he started driving away as we were getting our bags out of the back. Onlookers ran after and stopped him. He didn't apologize or anything. Overall staff friendliness was extremely poor. Also the "fitness centre" is literally a eliptical. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2016 Pros:Great staff, super friendly. Cons:Weird water soaked hallway carpet and funky smell.
