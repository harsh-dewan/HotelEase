Tameem Sayed Qatar 10 Doha is a very friendly city. Doha is a very friendly city. You get help whenever you need. The people is so warm hearted, just like the weather. But the problem is you don't see people around in the street or tourist areas as it is too hot outside in Oct. The transport in the city is superb! It's a lovely city, except the heat. Katherine New Zealand 10 The city of Doha is a nice place to visit. The city of Doha is a nice place to visit. It is calm and clean. REstaurants are very good with high quality of service and food. We used uber to get around the city and it was very convenient to see all the places we had our list, which were the Black Pearl, financial center and the old town with the Souk. People and nice and friendly everywhere. However the prices are very high even compared to European prices.

We went to Doha as a stopover on the way to India, I hadn’t been before but I had heard good things from friends. Coming from Ireland it isn’t too far and there are direct flights with Qatar Airways who are amazing! We were in the old traditional town which is beautiful with lovely restaurants and markets, the people are very friendly and it’s so clean and we felt safe. The hotels are amazing we stayed in two, Al Messila and Wyndham Grand Doha West Bay Beach I would recommend either! There is a nice boat trip to do, better at night to see all the lights, we only had a few days so we didn’t get to explore too much, the food is amazing, there are no bars as it’s not a drinking culture, however you can get served alcohol in most hotels, I would recommend The Irish Harp Bar at The Sheraton there’s a great band there and fun atmosphere! All in all it’s my new favourite winter destination and I will 100% be back soon!
