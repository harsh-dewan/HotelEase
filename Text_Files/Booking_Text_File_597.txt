What guests said about Stockholm: 10 The trip exceeded our expectations. The trip exceeded our expectations. The city is great, very clean and well maintained. Many attractions and views. A 4-day trip can cover most of the attractions but you should add an extra 1-2 days to visit more of what the city can offer ( boat trips, museums). The Ship Hotels are a great choice to stay offering a unique experience. We visited in November when is less crowded, but you should consider that the temperatures are a bit lower than summer and also sunset is around 15 00 - 16 00. Still Stockholm by night is amazing. Ciprian Margarint Romania 10 Stockholm is a diverse city in terms of it's preserved... Stockholm is a diverse city in terms of it's preserved heritage in Gamla Stan and the modern design in areas such as Vasastan. There are many museums ranging from photography to history/culture, as well as being the home of the Nobel Prize to which there is a museum dedicated to that as well. Getting to the city from the airport is a breeze with the train, then getting around the city on their metro system was efficient and safe. One of our favorite activities was winter kayaking out of Vaxholm, as well as a day trip to Skansen to learn about the heritage and history of the Swedes. We went during the American Thanksgiving week and enjoyed the Christmas markets in both Gamla Stan and Skansen as the goods being sold were handmade and represented artisans from different regions of the country.

We loved exploring Gamla stan and Djurg√•rden. The Vasa Museum and Skansen open-air museum were excellent and must-visits. There were many excellent bars and 'pubs' dotted about S√∂dermalm, Gamla stan and Vasastan. We enjoyed the touristy shopping along V√§sterl√•nggatan and Stora Nygatan, with more cultural boutiques along √ñsterl√•nggatan, all in Gamla stan. Busier shopping along Drottninggatan. Pretty cafes in Stortorget. Many boat cruises available to tour the archipelago. The metro was so easy to use. Many of the stations have some quite elaborate are installations so re worth checking out! Almost everywhere are card-only but some restaurants etc. take cash too. Food and drink, particularly wine, is very expensive when eating out. Cheaper to buy hotdogs in a Pressbyr√•n. To purchase alcohol for home consumption you must shop in a Systembolaget before 7pm or earlier but they are great shops. Matthew United Kingdom 10 We very much enjoyed visiting Stockholm and would love to... We very much enjoyed visiting Stockholm and would love to return. The people were friendly, the city is relatively clean (i.e., compared to other large cities), the transportation system is exceptional, and despite what we had heard about the high cost of living in Sweden, we found that hotels, restaurants, cafes, etc. were reasonably priced. (Admittedly, we did not have- or want- any high end/"fine dining" experiences.) We were there for three nights and could have easily spent a week without coming close to running out of things to see and do.
