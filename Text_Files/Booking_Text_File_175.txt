What guests said about Banff: 10 Banff is one of out favorite places to visit in Alberta. Banff is one of out favorite places to visit in Alberta. We always enjoy the warmth of this little town even in the middle of winter when it is covered in snow. The Buffalo Nations Museum, Bow River, Vermillion Lakes, Banff Upper Hot Springs and the Cave and Basin National Historic Site are places that every visitor should visit. The Balkan Restaurant and Pacini are two very good options for lunch or dinner. Melissa's MisSteak is great afterhours place where we were lucky to listen to some exceptional live music. It can be your base to visit its National park, Yoho National Park, Lakes Louise, Moraine and Spirit Island before moving on the Jasper and the surrounding area. Happy Traveller Canada 10 We were able to travel around Banff without using the car. We were able to travel around Banff without using the car. The ROAM bus service was fantastic, far reaching to all areas, ran to timetable and was available late at night. The selection of restaurants was fantastic, and there were other things to do such as live music events and quiz nights. I recomment Tooloulous for breakfast and Grizzly for dinner. The gondola to the top of Sulphur Mountain was efficient and good value for money. At the top there are excellent facilites and a wonderful boardwalk to take you to the top. The river walks are wonderful. Vivienne United Kingdom 10 A great choice for a Canadian holiday. A great choice for a Canadian holiday. Spectacular scenery, and great restaurants and pubs. Something for everyone to enjoy. The Gondola experience was fabulous, and dinner at the Sky Restaurant was beyond measure !! Sandra Canada 10 The staff were amazing, very helpful and friendly. The staff were amazing, very helpful and friendly. Room was very clean and made up each day in the morning. The hotel was close to downtown and restaurants. We didn't eat at the hotel, but the restaurant on premise looked very nice. The only other amenity that would have been appreciated would be a breakfast buffet included in the price or a take out coffee and quick breakfast facility. We would stay there again!! Canada 10 Banff is a beautiful place with a lot to do even if visiting... Banff is a beautiful place with a lot to do even if visiting late Oct. Tje scenery is beautiful no matter which direction you look. The town of Banff is beautifully situated for tourism. There are plenty of hotels and restaurants for any budget. Souvenirs can get pricey. Great place to eat is Arashi Ramen. Very busy, small place, but with the wait if you want ex Ellen’s ramen. Very walkable town. Freddie United States 10 Lovely little town with lots of shops and places to eat. Lovely little town with lots of shops and places to eat. A lot of touristy/merch shops but also several art galleries and nice souvenirs to buy. Beautiful surroundings. The gondola is great, we booked in advance with lunch at Sky Bistro which was very nice. Cheaper to book online it seemed, kind of a must if you want to eat as it can be very busy. Two Jack Lake, Johnson Lake and Lake Minnewanka are closeby and worth a visit. Bow falls is nice, could also check out Fairmont Banff Springs too. Explore guest reviews of hotels in Banff See all Banff Park Lodge Banff From CAD 154.25 per night 8.1 Very good · 1,295 reviews Check in was easy and the receptionist was really efficient and helpful. Our room was a fairly decent size, the view wasn't that great but we didn't spend huge amounts of time in the actual room. Our bathroom was particularly small but adequate for what we needed. The bed was genuinely really comfortable. We did think parking was expensive at $14 per day but actually we very quickly realised that parking in Banff is very limited, so parking under the hotel was absolutely worth every penny. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Rebecca United Kingdom Banff Caribou Lodge and Spa Banff From CAD 165.66 per night 7.8 Good · 1,854 reviews The short 15 minute walk from downtown Banff and all its amenities was a major plus, and the main reason we chose the hotel. The attached Keg restaurant was a nice surprise! Very friendly and helpful staff, they make an effort to answer your questions, volunteer information and advice, and ensure you're aware of options and services. We didn't get a chance to use the pool/spa facilities because of our short stay and busy schedule but those looked nice as well. K Kevin Canada Banff Voyager Inn Banff 6.3 Pleasant · 674 reviews After we arrived at Lake Louise, I found out that my wallet was lost. It was two days after I stayed at this hotel, but when I called to the front desk of this hotel, they said they had saved my wallet. They told me i can pick it up anytime. After we drove back to Banff from Lake Louise, I went to find my wallet and i didn’t lost anything from my wallet, Thank you very much for this hotel. I will check in again if I have a chance next time. X Xinlei Canada Banff Bear Bed & Breakfast Banff 9.7 Exceptional · 30 reviews Super clean and quiet rooms with beautiful decorations, 5 mins walk to Banff downtown. the hosts were friendly, responsive and thoughtful(they even recorded euro cup final for us considering we might have missed it the day we arrived!), while they were almost invisible to respect our privacy. This place easily beats 3/4 star hotels I stayed in Banff before, will definitely come back again! Yan Canada Banff Ptarmigan Inn Banff From CAD 191.23 per night 8.0 Very good · 2,493 reviews The location of this hotel is perfect. Right at the beginning of the downtown, so an easy walk to everything. Right outside the hotel is the bus shuttle, convent and the best way to get around Banff. We took it everywhere, the bus pass is also provided by the hotel. Having a warm breakfast every morning was also very welcoming. We very much enjoyed our stay. Yolanda Canada High Country Inn Banff From CAD 143.42 per night 8.6 Fabulous · 1,943 reviews We had stayed here 3 years ago and liked it. It's been noticeably renovated since then so even better.

Loved the free but secure indoor parking with easy access into the hotel. Stayed 5 nights, could've stayed another week! andrew United States The Juniper Hotel & Bistro Banff From CAD 134.40 per night 8.1 Very good · 861 reviews This hotel is overall alright, not in downtown Banff (you will need a car or a bike to reach the center) but in the woods outside of the town. Planty of space for car parcking. The price was off the roof... definetly not worth it. The pool was out of order, also quite disappointing Ornella Germany The Hidden Ridge Resort Banff From CAD 241.26 per night 7.9 Good · 1,955 reviews Really nice and quiet location. Easy to get to Banff center by public transport. The hotel provided us with free bus passes for the duration of our stay. The staff was very professional and friendly.

Agnieszka Canada Bow View Lodge Banff From CAD 149.48 per night 7.3 Good · 1,181 reviews The room was cozy Not to sound glib but ski hotels are their own thing.
