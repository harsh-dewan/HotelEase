Beside the Seaside, Beside the Sea A favoured holiday spot since the Victorian era, Blackpool is a traditional English seaside town. Amusement arcades and crazy golf courses line the promenade and dotted between them are plenty of places to pick up fresh fish ‚Äòn‚Äô chips and Blackpool rock. On the 5-mile sandy beach, children can enjoy Punch and Judy shows and donkey rides. Old-fashioned entertainment at its best. At the other end of the scale is the Blackpool Pleasure Beach, a fairground complex comprising a variety of rides, including The Big One - once the world‚Äôs tallest and steepest rollercoaster. They actually had to get permission from nearby Blackpool Airport to erect it! More seaside pursuits are on the town‚Äôs 3 piers, one of which is Grade II listed. However, the most recognisable landmark is the Blackpool Tower which houses a circus, 4D cinema and a world-renowned ballroom, to name a few. Modelled on the Eiffel Tower, it is spectacularly lit during the annual Blackpool Illuminations, when the whole town is bathed in bright lights. The trams plying the prom are also lit. Look out for the one shaped like a ship. A popular stag and hen do destination, Blackpool offers accommodation ranging from North Shore hotels to South Shore B&Bs - see Booking.com for the best choice.

What guests said about Blackpool: 8.0 Blackpool is unique, those visiting should go with little... Blackpool is unique, those visiting should go with little expectation and open mind. It is a mix of past tradition and history with the Tower lounge dance events and illuminations, to the more modern shows, comedians which can be an acquired humour and bustling bars. Gemma United Kingdom 10 Loved the fabulous Grand Theatre and the superb stage show... Loved the fabulous Grand Theatre and the superb stage show La Bamba that we went to see. Our comfortable, centrally located apartment also added to the enjoyment of our weekend away at Blackpool. Great restaurants all nearby too, highly recommend Amaros Lesley United Kingdom 10 I love Blackpool, Blackpool Zoo is a must it‚Äôs the best zoo... I love Blackpool, Blackpool Zoo is a must it‚Äôs the best zoo we have ever been too. We also visited Madam Tussaud‚Äôs which was enjoyed by all. The area was clean and tidy and there was plenty to do for all ages. Ample parking and the tram makes travelling around so easy. Prices are fair as well. The beach was well maintained and clean, beautiful views and plenty of areas to sit and enjoy it. Illuminations are the same old ones from years ago but still a nice outing especially for kids. Blackpool by the sea was a nice touch but expensive but again most street markets are. There are plenty of places to stay ranging on what you want to pay. Vicky United Kingdom 10 Plenty to do especially for children and young people. Plenty to do especially for children and young people.

Blackpool is cheap and cheerful. You visit to see the lights and tower etc. Loved visiting the tower ballroom on this occasion. Disappointing the tower isn‚Äôt open at this time of year. We were very lucky with the weather this time. Shame that the new trans have more or less replaced the old vintage ones which used to really add to the light show. I got the impression that the lights aren‚Äôt as good as they used to be but it has been many years since our last visit. A lot of empty looking hotels / premises which make the place look a bit dejected. Took the opportunity to look around local shopping centre which was very good. Struggled to find somewhere nice to eat in the evening, important to pre book everything g when visiting here.
