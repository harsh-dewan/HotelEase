My room has a small desk and a very small clothes hanging space. Free coffee in the morning, and decent wifi. The rooms are small with minimal decor, if you are okay with small space then you’re in for a steal of a deal in downtown New York. I will likely stay here again next year. J 4.0 Mediocre Josephine, Jan. 2023 Stayed here for 1 week in a private double room. It might be adequate for 1 person but way too small for 2 people. There is really nowhere to put our stuff and we only had one backpack each. Bathroom door and shower wall is all semi-frosted glass so there's no privacy. On top of which the door couldn't fully close-- think poop smells throughout the room each time someone had to go #2. Tv is tiny and doesn't swivel and when you open the window blinds it just covers half the tv. What a joke. The absolute worst thing about our stay was 3 full days of fire alarm testing that we were not made aware of before booking. Alarm testing started around 9am and went through the afternoon! Totally unacceptable! Not only could I not sleep in but I couldn't work from my hotel room. The alarms were nonstop and obnoxiously loud. I felt like I was being tortured and was forced to leave to find some peace. I had other options with even lower prices, so I would not have chosen to stay if I had known about the fire alarms beforehand. I asked the front desk about a discounted stay due to the fire alarm disturbance and not only did they say no, they weren't nice or apologetic about it. Also, the rooftop bar is closed until spring! It was a big reason for staying there. AND there is a $20 facility fee for each night! Overall, I do not recommend Pod 39. Location was mediocre, other than being close to Grand Central, it wasn't great. No food open late at night in that area. T 4.8 Mediocre Teresa, Oct. 2019 Cons:The beds are very uncomfortable. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Aug. 2018 Pros:Pretty much everything...loved the HDMI inputs on the wall, the awesome bathroom, the responsive AC, and of course, the staff. Cons:Nothing not to like...this is basically a well-managed upscale hostel with superior private rooms. I would totally recommend some tweaks for the designers, mainly to install a shelf on the wall near the LCD screen to maximize vertical space. I would also suggest a water kettle as an optional in-room item as I travel with my own cup and tea and missed this feature. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, May 2018 Pros:Perfect place to lay your head. Solo traveler also perfect. Didn’t need much room & conveniently in Manhattan. Walking distance to Time Square. T 7.7 Good Thomas, Feb. 2018 Pros:The price is unbeatable and the hotel is simple, clean and centrally located. Remember, this is NYC!!! Unbelievably affordable to spend some time in the Big Apple! Perfect for a no-thrills solo traveler. Cons:The USB port in the room didn't work so that I couldn't charge my phone. But it actually felt good to leave the phone in the hotel room and explore the neighborhood without social media. Quite the vacation and interesting to observe the people around you being glued to technology. D 9.7 Wonderful David, Dec. 2017 Pros:The location and the value for money were unmatchable as far as I have been able to tell. The beds were comfortable and the staff were all exceedingly pleasant. Cons:The bathroom isn’t really suited for families as there’s only a slim glass partition between you, so unless you’re creative you can hear and smell everything. The sink is also faulty and can disconnect easily. But there’s toilets downstairs and who even washes their hands anymore? W 9.7 Wonderful Wendy, Dec. 2017 Pros:Great location. Clean, stylish rooms with an efficient layout. Lovely bathroom. Yes, the rooms are small but I was expecting it and it was everything I needed. The staff is also very accommodating in keeping your luggage until you can check in, or holding your luggage if you have to check out before your flight leaves. Cons:I wish it was just a couple of blocks west to be closer to the tourist attractions, but that’s only because it was 20 degrees during my stay in NYC and every block felt like a mile when you’re freezing! A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jun. 2017 Pros:It has everything you could need in a compact package! Great location! Cons:If it had a mini fridge and microwave it would be the best place to stay in NYC for the money! A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2017 Pros:It was my first trip to New York. I was really impressed by the staffs and everyone at Pod 39. Very efficient and valuable hotel in New York. The location is very convenience. The hotel room was comfortable for one person or two people. I'm surprised of how clean the room was. The hotel maintain the cleanliness very well. Very reasonable prices. Cons:I wish they had a small fridge.
