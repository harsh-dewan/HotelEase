Definite bucket list item accomplished. I thought the parking cost should have been included in the cost of the hotel for the expensive specialty rooms we stayed in. Would have been nice to be able to order stadium food. My husband is handicapped and walks with a walker, had a fall going to the room due to a seam in the carpet that was pulled apart. M 6.0 Okay Morgan, Nov. 2021 Location is amazing. Came back to our room and found a man standing in our shower on the phone. Turned out our room as meant to be blocked off for renovation work. Had to move rooms. The couple who we were with changed rooms twice. Once because of an enormous amount of dust in the room (as if construction has been done on there and never cleaned up) and the last room they found a knife underneath the bed sheets. W 7.1 Good Waylon, Sep. 2020 Pros:Never any wait for the elevator or the Starbucks! Cons:Quite a bit is closed like the Club room, vending machines and ice machines, the rooms facing the baseball stadium, due to low occupancy levels I’m guessing. A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Pros:Supurb downtown location. The lobby bar view of the baseball field inside the Rogers Centre was pretty cool and would be awesome on game day. Cons:Lousy view from our city view room on the 1st floor. Fitness center was nice but lacking a sauna , change area and sundries and other simple amenities. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Pros:The room was big and had a view of the rogers centre, which we loved. Really liked that the screen tv welcomes you by your name, I thought that was excellent customer service. The bathroom was nicely decorated and I felt it was different then the regular hotel room. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Pros:Location and available valet parking saved us a lot of stress. Very friendly, helpful staff Cons:We were booked for 3 people and only had 2 coffee cups. No microwave which should be standard A 4.5 Mediocre Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Pros:the location and the room was clean. Cons:the manager isnt truthful and gives a horrible scammer vibe. its a long story, but he just lies to secure a sale and is very deceitful. also hotel management was slow and needed to be called multiple times for small concerns. it was annoying having to keep calling and reminding them. also the hotel had loud and disturbing noises as early as 6am and throughout the morning which made waking up very unpleasant. also no toothpaste, and the tv remote was missing. A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2018 Pros:The convenience, it’s close to the majority of the tourist attractions and great places to eat. Cons:Only thing, the room had a bit of a pet smell too it. I have a dog at home, so it wasn’t enough to bother me, but definitely noticeable and unexpected. A 9.4 Wonderful Anonymous, Nov. 2017 Pros:We took train, then walked mostly through skyway bridges from airport. Staff was friendly, room clean and ready for us. One night stay, was a comfortable rest. Was able to use Netflix to watch a show. Cons:Recreation areas not available during our short stay. S 6.0 Okay Silvia, Nov. 2017 Pros:The staff is extremely helpful and the location is great, right by the CN tower, walking distance to Union Station (about 10 minutes). The room I stayed in was very spacious. Cons:The hotel was being renovated, so there was no convenient access to a pool or fitness centre (you would have to go to the Delta hotel a couple of blocks away for that); the ice machine/vending machine room on my floor was locked with no sign or note explaining the reason or where to go for an open ice/vending machine room -- maybe those are also being renovated. My particular room seemed to be in need of renovations as well (like caulking the bathtub). After the renovations are completed things should be OK, but I was really disappointed as I had no heads up about these issues and would have booked a different hotel if I had known about them.
