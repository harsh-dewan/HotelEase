What guests said about Barcelona: 8.0 Barcelona is not the place it once was when I visited... Barcelona is not the place it once was when I visited regularly over 15 years ago. Honestly, I'd hate to be there in the Summer. For example, the area around the Sagradia Familia is truly appalling for this world class site and is totally given over to the lowest common denominator tourist tat which ruined it for us. Think London's Piccadilly on steroids. The City also needs to up its game in terms of signing for pedestrians - there's very little and this is generally not helpful. The city itself, however is remarkably clean and puts British cities like London and Manchester to shame. So ten out of ten for that. My biggest beef however was the 'free' entry to the The Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. You book a ticket to 'avoid queues' and guess what? You still have to queue and for a very long time. If you haven't got a ticket and you want to take pot luck, after all you're feeling fancy free and you're on holiday, you'll have to wait until the never ending line of ticket holders is batch fed in with no indication of when second class non-ticket holders are ever getting across the threshold. After 30 minutes we gave up. A total shambles and you can't help but think that the queues make it artificially busy. It's still a great city though and you'll always have a good time. The Metro is incredibly practical and easy to work out and you can get wherever you want for around just ¬£2 a trip. However overall, in my opinion Barcelona has lost a considerable bit of its magic and good vibe which limits its appeal for repeat visits... maybe in another 15 years. Geoff Royle United Kingdom 10 Barcelona is love at first sight... you can't resist it... Barcelona is love at first sight... you can't resist it... It's true magic to get lost in the Gothic quarter... it has its own sweetness too... trust me it will reward you with sights from another era. .. Transportation is easy and accessible wherever you are... you won't struggle at all... Their food is excellent... prefer the small shops inside the market and also on La Rampla... all of them are amazing as to foreigners... Favorite places the hill of Montju√Øc... prefer the time when the sun goes to sleep... incredible colors... and then a nice walk in Barceloneta... it's love... Katerina-Katia 8.0 Sagrada Familia was impressive - booked fast track access... Sagrada Familia was impressive - booked fast track access with guide and it was the right amount of info and time. Also booked Park Guell the day before - people were unable to get in on the day, so good to book in advance as it's a bit of a hike to get there. It's a bigger park/garden than expected - not just the area with tiled buildings and walkways - so allow time to walk around. 48 hour metro ticket was good value and got us out to airport on last day as well as around the city and on a quick trip to the beach. Peter Jersey 8.0 Barcelona is a lovely city to walk around in. Barcelona is a lovely city to walk around in. This was my second time in the city for a work conference. I stayed in the Les Court neighborhood, and walked to many places, then used public transport to return. There are a number of different eating options no matter where you are. I had a great vegan meal at the Cat Bar, which offered a cactus burger. It was very good. Juana United States 10 Always a great place to visit, you never get enough of the...
