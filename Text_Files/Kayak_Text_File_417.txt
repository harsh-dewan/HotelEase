Liked that they encourage people to be green and give them the resources to do so! The bathroom items were a very nice touch. Bright, clean rooms. Would stay again, though I have some suggestions.. Cons:The front desk staff wasn't exactly helpful.. they asked if I had stayed here before and I said "No", and then he didn't inform me I needed to scan my card to use the elevator, so I was stuck pushing buttons wondering "what the heck?" for a several minutes before I poked my head out and he informed me I had to scan my card... He also asked me 3 times how many key cards I needed. A lot of the lights in the hallway and in my room were in disrepair (they turned on, but the shades didn't sit straight on them, which gave the appearance of disrepair). One of the light shades in my room was completely missing a piece and sat directly on top of a lightbulb, which is a huge fire hazard. They provided earplugs to deal with the fact that the hotel is directly on Whyte Avenue and a bit noisy... except that the little box with the earplugs didn't actually have a pair of earplugs in it (it was just an empty box). Finally, the shower mat didn't have any kind of slip resistance. When I went to get out of the shower, it completely slipped out from under me against the smooth tile flooring and I fell back into the shower, injuring my hip. The entire side of my body is riddled with bruises because of the fall. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jan. 2017 Pros:Location is excellent - among the many restaurants, bars and small shops on Whyte Avenue. Rooms are well-appointed, stylish and very clean. Staff was professional and friendly. Included breakfast was high quality with hot and cold items. Cons:My only criticism is that the plumbing was getting worse for wear (drain stopper in sink didn't work).
