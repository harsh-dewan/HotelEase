Pros: -subway is in the same building -lots of restaurants around but neighbourhood is not that great so keep that in mind. -comfy beds Cons: -rooms are ok. No one came to do our room but they came in and exchange one towel only which was really odd. -We asked for extra towel+ robe since there were 3 of us in the room and only got 1 towel back. -front desk seemed a bit overwhelmed by the hockey tournament and the 50 + kids around so I understand but other guests shouldn't have to take a hit. -Ventilation in room doesn't work properply.
