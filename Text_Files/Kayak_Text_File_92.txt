Basic room. Comfortable beds and pillows. Cons:No parking. A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Dec. 2017 Pros:The location and cost was great! Cons:There was hair in the bathroom and the location brings noise if you open the windows. A 4.0 Mediocre Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Pros:Price was low, and the neighborhood is lively at night. We found a good restaurant for dinner and a bar for a drink within a few blocks of the hotel. Cons:I called in advance to ask the height limit on the parking garage and was told the wrong height; my vehicle was unable to fit. Upon check in they needed my email confirmation printed out and sent me to the business center. Why it needed to be printed? I don't know. They already had my reservation printed out in a folder behind the desk. During check in, they wrote my credit card number and expiration date on the printout. This doesn't seem safe. The room's bathroom was nice, but the bedroom was dated. There were bars on the windows but they weren't locked. Why? Again, I don't know. They should be locked in that neighborhood. I parked on the street because I could not find a garage to fit my vehicle, and it was broken into over night. Upon further inspection, the street is littered with broken vehicle glass, and people walking by said it happens all the time. The cop who responded said drug addicts do this all the time in order to find something to sell for a quick score. C 5.1 Fair CTS, Aug. 2017 Pros:Price and location Cons:Small room Small bed Parking $20 extra - not advertised Parking 1 block from hotel No elevator A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Dec. 2016 Pros:The location was great. Walk to shops, train station. Bus pickup for Capilano bridge. Cora resturant next door handy cheap option. No coffee machine. Could do with a cosmetic touch up. A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2016 Pros:Close to everything. Clean room. Good Amenities. Cons:No elevator, no electric key. M 8.5 Very good Michael, Apr. 2016 Pros:Great central location, room was comfortable, clean, and well-maintained Cons:I could hear everything (and I mean everything!) from the room above me. Sometimes the room would smell a little stale when I first came in, but opening the windows for a few minutes would clear it out (love that the windows actually open!). A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2016 Pros:The Barclay is in a great location- walking distance to shops, restaurants, Coal Harbour and easily accessible to Stanley Park. This is an older hotel but even with the updates it still has dated charm. There is no elevator and overnight parking is available the next block over in a city lot. A 8.2 Very good Anonymous, Dec. 2016 Pros:Good staff and location. Cons:No handy parking for a tall vehicle. A 7.1 Good Anonymous, Oct. 2015 Pros:Decent value for the money, very clean Cons:There was a 1/4" gap between door and door frame, and cigarette smoke was coming into my lower level room directly from the hallway my first night there--yech! The fire alarm in my room was covered with a paper towel and plastic, not exactly current on safety. Last gripe is that the pillows were insanely thick and hard for me to sleep on.
