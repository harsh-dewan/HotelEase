You can hear the elevators all day and night. T 6.5 Okay Thomas, Dec. 2020 Pros:Location was great. Just a few steps away from everything. The discounted parking for self parking option was goo deal compared to other nearby options . Lot of eating options nearby Cons:Tiny Rooms and small beds.. The rooms and walk way looks dull (may be because of their low lighting theme) . A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, May 2019 Pros:Friendly, helpful staff, clean room, wonderful Theater location Z 6.8 Okay Zoltan, Mar. 2019 Cons:Location is great hotel is ok. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2019 Pros:great location, clean room lots of restaurants around. C 6.8 Okay Carrie, Jun. 2018 Pros:The hotel was cool, nicely decorated, and the maid service was excellent. Cons:It was my fault for making the reservation under my name, but we realized this the day before. I called and they added my husband name, no problem. Well when my husband arrived they told him I had to be there ( I was flying in later that night), so I call and they say his name is in the reservation and they don’t know why he can’t check in. I ask to speak to the front desk. 3 HOURS and multiple calls and multiple run arounds, still not talking to to the front desk; a person at the call center tells me he checked already! I talk to my husband who nis sitting on a bench inside with my two daughters sleeping in his lap. I tell him to try and check in, they check him in. A breakdown in communication led to a rough start. A 8.5 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Pros:The hotel is in a fabulous location in the middle of the theater district. Once you step into the hotel the city smell is gone and replaced by a blast of fragrance. The lobby is wide and decorated nicely. The elevator system is very efficient with elevators going to certain floors. The room was comfortable enough for the 3 of us. Cons:They never have enough people working at the desk. There are always lines throughout the day. A desk for questions would be helpful. For a hotel with 1,331 rooms they need more than 2-3 people assisting guests. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2017 Pros:nice lobby Cons:check-in took WAY too long. wallpaper in room was tacky A 6.2 Okay Anonymous, Jul. 2017 Pros:The furniture and the look of the room was nice; very modern. Also seemed very clean. Priced reasonably. Cons:Check in took quite a while and when we got to the counter the employee said she was upgrading us but I don't believe that was the case because the room was very small. One very simple thing was that there was no full length mirror which does not help when I'm getting ready for my boyfriend's birthday dinner.
