It was comfortable and clean. Cons:The breakfast included was not the best. It was in a cramped space at the end of the Ampersand restaurant. The breakfast offerings were only so so. We liked eating out at the nearby restaurants instead. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:It's right on Whyte Ave, parking is close (free), staff is friendly and very helpful but most of all it is clean! I will be a repeat customer!
