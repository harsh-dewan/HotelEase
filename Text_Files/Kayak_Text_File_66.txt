Toronto has the National Veterans Parade at the CNE which has been highly attended over the decades. Free CNE entrance, free TTC, free Via rail etc. that day has been legendary. Please consider Honouring your Veterans for their service. They have show excellence in serving you. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Oct. 2021 The bathroom was extremely small for two people. Someone told me I should have taken the gold level. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jan. 2020 Pros:Location is perfect. Beautiful hotel. J 8.8 Very good James, Jan. 2020 Pros:The check out person was friendly and polite and the hotel itself was beautiful. Cons:The check in gentlemen was a bit rude and didn’t smile. Super awkward. J 10.0 Wonderful Judy, Mar. 2019 Pros:The staff was incredibly friendly and extremely attentive to our needs. We requested a quiet room and received what we asked for. Everything was immaculate and having a pool and a health club with a steam room was an added bonus to our stay. Cons:If you drive and park over overnight leaving on a work day morning can be a little difficult as Union station is across the street and morning commuters tend to walk directly into the path of where you exit the Fairmont in your car. It would help to have a hotel employee come out and assist with clearing vehicular and pedestrian traffic so you can exit the Fairmont in your car safely. J 6.5 Okay Jennifer, Mar. 2019 Pros:Bed was comfortable Cons:Heating system was loud. Walls were paper thin. Could hear room conversations as I passed doors. Especially being placed so super close to the elevator. B 10.0 Wonderful BJ, Dec. 2018 Pros:We traveled by Via and walked right across the street. Library bar is lovely. Rooms very spacious and comfortable. Everyone should give themselves a treat and stay at the Royal York.
