Quiet but still close to all the action. Plus it has its own adventure centre so you can leave for tours right from your doorstep. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2016 Pros:Loved the location, easy walk to everything. Nice to have a little fridge and kitchenette. Cons:WIFI super slow. Expect to do your own dishes; housekeeping is by request only which helps the environment I suppose but just be ready for it. A 8.2 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2016 Pros:Loved the location, with very nice restaurants near by. Personnel was very kind and smiley. Cons:Very very basic rooms, A 6.0 Okay Anonymous, Mar. 2016 Pros:I liked the addition of the continental breakfast this year. Cons:They've started to not offer housekeeping unless you call before noon. What?? That's just too weird. No one came in to empty the garbage or refill the coffee. They should offer better rates with the subtraction of those services. A 4.2 Mediocre Anonymous, Feb. 2016 Pros:Staff were excellent, friendly energetic courteous and helpful. Cons:Needs new carpet and paint immediately. New beds next, worn out. Updating of bathrooms and furniture soon. J 7.1 Good jpoll71, Jul. 2015 Pros:It was nice to be close to the town where we were able to walk everywhere. Nice to accept pets n rooms very spacious. Would definitely stay again. Cons:Being on 2nd floor, was a bit of a view but was noisy from people above. Staying again would be worth going one floor higher not to have someone above. Just a little TLC needed to bring it up to date...
