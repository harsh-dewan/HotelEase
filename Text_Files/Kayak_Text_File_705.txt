A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Sep. 2016 Pros:The staff let me have an extended check out time so that I could use wifi to complete an online exam. I was on a large road trip and thought the motel provided enough of what I needed on a good price point. I'm not a luxury traveller. I just need the basics. They delivered and were very kind. Cons:Not exactly 'modern' looking accommodations. But, it was clean. Wifi was good. A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Aug. 2016 Pros:It was a good room in a very convenient place in terms of accessing the airport as well as other city sites. The room was clean and it was relatively quiet throughout the night. The staff was very helpful and offered an upgrade at no extra charge.
