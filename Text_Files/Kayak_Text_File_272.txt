If you are looking for a place to crash in I recommend it, but if you wanna enjoy your stay in a inn I don't recommend this. Cons:How old the place was and itchy there bed was. The sanitation of the place is just horrible. The smell of the hallway even thought it was non smoking still smells like tabaco and drunk people all over the place. The entrance smells like liquor and the staff at night was just horrible specially the young lady who check me in is rude as f. That place needs some renovation badly I mean it's cheap but just a horrible place. I only pick this hotel because it just 5mins away to my gf house.
