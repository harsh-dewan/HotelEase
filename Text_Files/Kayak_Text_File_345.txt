A 6.8 Okay Anonymous, May 2016 Pros:Love the location. 2 blocks away from the sky train, which was perfect for the reason for our stay - Calgary Comic Expo. Loved the customer service that the breakfast staff provided. Pretty sure the lady that serves us was still there from last year. She is the ONLY reason I gave 3 stars for staff! Cons:Front desk service SUCKED! There was a wedding booked at the same time as our stay. The room we were given was sub-par. The toilet leaked. We called down to the front desk and encountered resistance. Almost as if to say "so what do you want me to do about it?". Was informed that he would call back shortly, as he was busy. It took over an hour for the call back. Once front desk had determined that the leak was legit (half a trashcan full within an hour), he THEN switched us rooms, again to a sub-par room. No apology was given, infact, while the agent was figuring out which room to give, he complained about one of the other guests (they were asking how to get downstairs). While I totally understand that people get busy, stressed out or just plain have " had enough", there was absolutely NO reason to act this way towards someone that was also paying for a room. This was a return visit due to how well we were treated the first time. Unfortunately, based on THIS experience, we will be seeking an alternative hotel for our next Expo trip. R 6.0 Okay Ralph, Nov. 2014 Pros:Staff was friendly Cons:Check in time is 4pm that seemed late. The pillows were very small and too firm. The beds weren't comfortable. The room was small I had to get beside the toilet to open the door. R 8.5 Very good Robert, Oct. 2014 Pros:Great location for my purposes, rooms are basic, but the price is reasonable, and I wasn't expecting a resort at this price. Internet was good at all the times I used it, the pub is good, and the food was good. Cons:Parkade is under construction, rooms are dated, but clean. Continental breakfast could use more variety.
