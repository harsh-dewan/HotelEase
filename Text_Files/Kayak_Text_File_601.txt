The stay experience was good enough for us. Having the more premium sister hotel across the street with a pool/hot tub was nice to have access to. F 9.4 Wonderful Francis, Oct. 2018 Pros:The pool and the view. Cons:Everything was great. A 9.1 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2018 Pros:loved the location, the view from my room, and the overall good feeling I had when I walked into the room. Comfortable bed, very clean bathroom with lots of towels, quiet for sleeping, etc. Also there were extra blankets available in the room (if needed); that was appreciated. Cons:the ledges along the windows/patio door could have been vacuumed a little better - none the less, it was still a clean room both in the bedroom/sitting area and the bathroom A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Jun. 2016 Pros:This lodge was perfectly located for our weekend in Banff. We ran the Banff marathon on Sunday, and we could not beat the location and value of this hotel. The staff were great. I would stay there again. Cons:As others have noted, earplugs are helpful. Noise was not a big issue for us, but you can hear conversations in the hallway while in the room.
