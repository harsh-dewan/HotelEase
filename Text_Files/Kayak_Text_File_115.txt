Cons:un poco lejos para perder usar el transporte publico R 4.5 Mediocre Robert, Sep. 2017 Pros:The room was large and the bed was comfortable. Easy transport to, and from, the airport. Cons:- No power outlets near the beds. If you want to charge your phone at night, you have to do it elsewhere. Even over by the desk there was only 1 power outlet available. - The room wasn't exactly clean. There was some sort of mold around the edges of the tub, where it met the tile, which looked disgusting. The light switch was absolutely gross. - 2 hours after check-in, my credit card alerted me that they had charged me for an additional 193.15, even though I had already paid for my room. When I went down to the front desk, they waffled around and finally said it was just a hold and it was normal and it would be refunded when I checked out. I again asked why they charged me more than the cost of the room that I had already paid for and they were unable to tell me. If it was just a "oh he took something from the min-bar" type hold, it was an oddly specific amount. If links are allowed, here is a link to pictures I took in the hotel showing how unclean it was: http://imgur.com/a/kKD0U This hotel is a hard pass for me. I should have known better than to stray from established chains. J 8.0 Very good Jim, Jul. 2017 Pros:Comfortable rooms. Cons:Service was slow in the restaurant. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Nov. 2016 Pros:Loved the pool and hot tub. The room was a great size and very stylish! C 10.0 Wonderful Cynthia, Sep. 2016 Pros:The staff went above and beyond everything we asked, even when we just needed to know how to find restaurants and stores in the area. The suite was beautiful and absolutely comfortable, with one of the best beds we've found in a hotel, and the same could be said for the shower. With the close vicinity of the airport, landing planes fly quite close to the hotel frequently, and we noticed just how loud they were while we were unloading the car in the parking lot. We were concerned about how we'd be sleeping with such noise going on all night. Imagine our delight to discover that, once we were in the room, we almost couldn't hear the planes at all, unless we were listening carefully for them. Honestly, for the price, we were blown away to have a suite with a full kitchen included. Parking was complimentary as well. I can't say enough about this hotel. We will stay here again when we return to the Toronto area - no question about it Cons:Absolutely nothing. A 7.4 Good Anonymous, Jul. 2016 Pros:Clean hotel, nice views Cons:small pool, parking is charged, wifi was mediocre. No affordable food options in a 15-block radius (I know cuz I walked). A 7.7 Good Anonymous, Sep. 2015 Pros:rooms were very comfortable Cons:internet kept cutting in and out and Moxie's was way too expensive especially for breakfast and not well kept A 9.3 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2014 Pros:Close to airport Cons:Heater fan would shut off even though the thermostat was off Location 55 Reading Crt, Toronto, ON M9W 7K7 What's nearby High Park11.3 km Exhibition Place15.4 km Kensington Market15.7 km Royal Ontario Museum15.9 km University of Toronto15.9 km Art Gallery Of Ontario16.4 km TIFF Bell Lightbox16.7 km Princess of Wales Theatre16.8 km Rogers Centre17 km Nathan Phillips Square17.1 km CN Tower17.1 km Ripley's Aquarium of Canada17.2 km Policies Check-in/Check-out Check in anytime after 3:00 PM, check out anytime before 12:00 PM Cancellation/prepayment Cancellation/prepayment policies vary by room type and provider.
