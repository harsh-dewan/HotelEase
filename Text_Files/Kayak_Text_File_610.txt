First time I requested a new room to avoid this. They sent technicians up to fix it and they did fix it... but it did the same thing again the next night at 1am. Techs dame up and ended up replacing a part. I would have preferred to just move rooms the first time, but the customer service re said they have to have a tech come up and check it out first... she probably thought I was lying and trying to get an upgraded room. lol and the rooms we stayed in and got a complimentary upgrade in at check in, didn’t have mini fridges... I thought most places had that in Vegas J 8.0 Very good Joe, Feb. 2020 Pros:Location ...but it was a double edged sword.. Loud because of its location to Fremont st Cons:Noise reduction at an earlier time A 8.8 Very good Anonymous, Jan. 2020 Pros:All staff was helpful and courteous. We had a great time! Cons:Everything was wonderful. If I had to complain about anything, I would say that there was some street noise until quite late, but the hotel couldn't help that. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jul. 2019 Pros:Cleanliness and quietness Cons:Nothing A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Jul. 2019 Pros:Location Cons:A tub would have been nice. M 5.7 Fair Mathew, Jun. 2019 Pros:The location is perfect for a couple of days in downtown Las Vegas. The hotel pool was nice though it does need shade and it should stay open past 7 PM. Cons:The showers seem to have mildew. The carpets turned to the bottoms of my white socks nearly black. In the past year it seems that housekeeping does not do as attentive a job as my last visit. They were hand and butt imprints on the window from the last guest. M 9.1 Wonderful Mathew, Jun. 2019 Pros:Loved the king bed and sofa suite; loved the location; loved the coffee stop just off the elevators in the casino. Loved easy access to the hotel from Fremont Street. Cons:I didn't know there was a fitness center or business center to print my boarding pass. They should promote that more. K 7.7 Good Kathy, Jun. 2019 Cons:Very noisy on Fremont. Hall smelled like pot quite often but that was not hotel fault. They dealt promptly without us even having to mention it J 6.8 Okay James, Jun. 2019 Pros:The casino is right on Fremont Street. Cons:The rooms are dated and lacking in standard creature comforts most hotels provide. I.e. bedside outlets/Usb ports, refrigerator, coffee pot, hairdryer or bottled water. M 9.7 Wonderful Mathew, Mar. 2019 Pros:Loved being on Freemont street. Location was great. Big clean room. Felt very new. Cons:My room was above a music stage, so sleeping anytime before 1am was impossible; but this is Vegas, so who wants to sleep before 1am? Other than the noise, not much to critique.
