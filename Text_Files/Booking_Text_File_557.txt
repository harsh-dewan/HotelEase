Enchanting Island of Unspoilt Nature The 2nd largest Channel Island, Guernsey has a rugged coastline, unspoilt countryside and secluded beaches. Although a dependency of Britain, its proximity to Normandy‚Äôs shores means that it has a distinct French feel. Home to the greatest number of Guernsey hotels, St Peter Port ‚Äì the island‚Äôs capital ‚Äì is the arrival point for ferries from England, France and the other Channel Islands. Looking back at the multi-coloured buildings across the harbour is Castle Cornet, protectively guarding the town. Just south is beautiful Fermain Bay whose sand and pebble beach is sheltered by tree-covered cliffs. Neighbouring St Martin‚Äôs parish has a couple of Guernsey hotels with swimming pools, by the coast and inland. West is St Saviour parish where Guernsey Airport is located. In the north the coastline is flatter and the beaches longer. Once such beach is at Cobo Bay in Castel parish, where long swathes of sand are lined by a sea wall. Vale to the east has a castle perched precariously on the cliff edge. Booking.com has an excellent selection of guest houses and hotels in Guernsey, an island small enough to be explored in one trip. Whilst you‚Äôre travelling around, look out for the brown-and-white Guernsey cows, and the bright blue post boxes and telephone boxes.
