Near the southern tip is Chale, next to Blackgang Chine children‚Äôs amusement park, and close to Ventnor, on a hill sloping to the sea. Around the coast are the most popular beach resorts: Sandown with its nature reserve, and Shanklin with its cute Old Village and the most Isle of Wight hotels with indoor pools on Booking.com.
