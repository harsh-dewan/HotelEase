Apparently, I had missed the fact that check-in could not be before 3pm when doing my reservation, but I was given a room as soon as I arrived, around noon, and even got an upgrade to a suite. A 4.5 Mediocre Anonymous, Feb. 2019 Pros:Breakfast not included in such expensive package !! Seriously Cons:At least include the breakfast lol A 6.8 Okay Anonymous, Jan. 2018 Pros:Staff Cons:Comfort A 5.7 Fair Anonymous, Mar. 2016 Pros:Good location and friendly front desk staff Cons:Didn't like the half a dozen hairs that were in my bathtub upon checking in. And I really didn't like the three attempts by staff to get into my room before checkout, the first being at 8:00am with no knock. If check out is at 11:00am, then please respect my privacy and right to comfort in the room that I have paid for. A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Oct. 2015 Cons:Too loud at night, unable to rest well. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2014 Pros:The hotel is lovely and the room splendid and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again. Cons:What I didn't like is the fact that through no fault of ours, we were not there for the first nhight. Our plane was late leaving ORD and when we arrived in LaGuardia the connecting flight was cancelled and we could not get out of NYC until the next day. If we booked directly with the hotel they would have given us a refund but, we could not get a refund because we booked through Kayak. I would really appreciate a refund for that first night from Kayak. I never used Kayak before and I think this would be good customer service. Thank you! A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Oct. 2014 Pros:They upgraded us to a "condo". It was a huge room with a balcony and a nice view. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. The cleaning staff was efficient. Cons:They didn't replace the coffee pack we used the first morning. M 9.0 Wonderful Marielia, Jun. 2014 Pros:The staff was really friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet offered a lot of yummy options. The rooms were clean and spacious. Cons:The hotel needs an update. It's efficient but it feels a little dated.
