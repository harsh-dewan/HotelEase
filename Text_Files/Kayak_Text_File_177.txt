Quite old. N 6.0 Okay Nadya, Apr. 2023 Firstly, the staff were all very good, warm and welcoming. The hotel was clean, decor was nice. We went with some family who all got upgraded rooms, however we were staying longer and had the basic room. We went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast and it was a one star experience. Food was mediocre at best, portions were tiny tiny and not worth the price at all - even for a "fancy" restaurant. This place is about location only i guess. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Mar. 2022 Nice hotel and room. A 5.9 Fair Anonymous, Sep. 2021 The website did not disclose that the fitness center and the restaurant were both closed or that it was a site for people quarentining for covid. A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Sep. 2018 Pros:Very convenient to all downtown attractions Underground parking Lots of restaurants in area Walking distance to everything- Union station an easy 7 min walk A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Jul. 2018 Pros:Friendly staff Great pool Big rooms Late check out L 10.0 Wonderful Liso, Mar. 2018 Pros:The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The room was spacious, relaxing and the harbour view was just relaxing we actually ended up staying an extra night. Large shower, lots of towels. They brought in a microwave on request. Location is walking distance (even with a little one) to CN Tower and major central Toronto attractions. It's convenient that you have the parking even after checkout - until 6pm of your departure date. We came in March but I would consider it again in.summer to use the pool and patio. Cons:Can't think of anything A 8.0 Very good Anonymous, Mar. 2018 Pros:The reservation was booked over a month in advance on Kayak for a conference but upon arrival there was no record of my reservation. The Staff were very concerned and were able to get me a room in an otherwise fully booked hotel. A 9.7 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2018 Pros:The staff was great and went above and beyond when needing assistance or needing to find a store Cons:The grout in the shower was a bit dirty and well as the ceiling A 10.0 Wonderful Anonymous, Feb. 2018 Cons:Cost of breakfast, but was still very great food!
